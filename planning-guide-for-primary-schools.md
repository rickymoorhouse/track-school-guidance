Purpose of this document
------------------------

On 10 May the Prime Minister announced a roadmap towards recovery,
including plans for the [phased return of some
children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-and-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020){.govuk-link}
to school from the week commencing 1 June.

We have created a [planning
framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-and-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020/opening-schools-for-more-children-and-young-people-initial-planning-framework-for-schools-in-england){.govuk-link}
to help school leaders to prepare and decide arrangements for more
children returning to school. It’s a starting point from which schools
may choose to develop their own plans. This planning guide builds on
that – it gives school leaders the ‘next-level down’ of detail from the
planning framework.

This guide has been designed by school leaders for school leaders. It is
intended to provide a step by step guide for headteachers and senior
colleagues to prepare for extending their opening to include all pupils
in reception, year 1 and year 6 from the week commencing 1 June,
alongside priority groups ([vulnerable
children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people){.govuk-link}
and the [children of critical
workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision){.govuk-link}).
Eligible children should be offered a full-time place. Schools are not
required to use this guide, and may choose to follow alternative
approaches to preparing for wider opening, or to use some sections of
this guidance alongside other approaches. We hope that some of these
suggestions will be helpful to headteachers who are leading this
important work, to support their own decision-making.

### Timeframe this document covers

This guide covers the first phase of wider opening from the week
commencing 1 June. The government’s ambition is for all primary school
children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible.
This position will be kept under review, and further advice will be
provided as and when needed.

Options for delivery
--------------------

Schools should not plan on the basis of a rota system, either daily or
weekly. This guide sets out other options for schools if they are unable
to cater for all of the vulnerable children, children of critical
workers, nursery children (where applicable – any pre-existing, standard
rotas may remain unchanged), reception pupils, year 1s and year 6s with
their available staff or in their available space.

In most cases the preparation for wider opening will be undertaken by
the headteacher and senior colleagues. However, relevant bodies (such as
local authorities, academy trusts or governing bodies, depending on the
school type) them should support and work with the headteacher, and
should particularly assure themselves that risk assessments of the
school opening more widely, before pupils and staff return, are carried
out appropriately and measures put in place to address identified risks.

We expect schools and trusts to work closely with:

-   parents, staff and unions as they normally would, when agreeing the
    best approaches for their circumstances
-   their local authorities to determine what services they require and
    agree on any specific arrangements during this period

A similar guide for early years settings will be published shortly.
Schools with nursery classes, 2-year-old provision and maintained
nursery schools, may wish to consult this guidance.

Much of this will be relevant and useful for special schools and
alternative provision (AP) providers, though it has not been developed
for those settings.

While aiming to be comprehensive, the guide may not be exhaustive and
there may again be particular circumstances which necessitate the
consideration of factors not covered here.

This guide does not supersede any legal obligations relating to health
and safety, employment or equalities and it is important that as an
employer you continue to comply with your existing obligations,
including those relating to individuals with protected characteristics.
It contains non-statutory guidance to take into account when complying
with these existing obligations. When considering how to apply this
guidance, take into account agency workers, contractors and other
people, as well as your employees.

Background
----------

As a result of the huge efforts everyone has made to adhere to strict
social distancing measures, the transmission rate of coronavirus
(COVID-19) has decreased. We therefore anticipate, with further
progress, that we may be able, from the week commencing 1 June 2020 to
welcome back more children to early years settings, schools and
colleges. Primary schools are being asked to welcome back all children
currently in nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6. This guide is
designed to support schools’ planning for this phase of return.

From 1 June at the earliest, secondary schools will also be asked to
provide some face-to-face support for pupils in year 10 and year 12
facing exams next year to supplement their remote education. We will be
working with sector representatives over the coming week to develop
models of how this could operate, and this will be published along with
further guidance for secondary schools shortly.

[1. ]{.number} Preparing the site
---------------------------------

### Health and safety check of the building

If your whole school site or buildings have been closed for many weeks,
or if parts of the building have been out of use for a long period, then
you should consider undertaking a health and safety check of the
buildings concerned. You should speak to your trust or local authority
about this if you are unsure whether you need it or how to commission
it.

Read more about [managing school premises during the coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/managing-school-premises-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak){.govuk-link}.

You might also need to make adjustments to your fire drill and practise
it in the first week when more pupils return. Refer to advice on [fire
safety in new and existing school
buildings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-in-new-and-existing-school-buildings){.govuk-link}.

### Cleaning and hygiene

You will want to decide and make clear to the school staff and parents
what your expectations are about cleaning and hygiene.

Once children are back in school, all frequently touched surfaces,
equipment, door handles and toilets used during the day will need to be
cleaned thoroughly each day. Talk to your cleaning provider about what
will be needed.

Refer to guidance on [cleaning non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}
for more information.

The guidance on [implementing protective measures in education and
childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}
provides detailed advice on measures schools need to consider.

You may also wish to consider your plans for:

-   the availability of soap and hot water in every toilet (and if
    possible in classrooms)
-   the location of hand sanitiser stations, for example at the school
    entrance for pupils and any other person passing into the school to
    use, and their replenishment
-   the location of lidded bins in classrooms and in other key locations
    around the site for the disposal of tissues and any other waste,
    their double bagging and emptying
-   ensuring you have a good supply of disposable tissues to implement
    the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach in each classroom and
    enough to top up regularly

See [annex d: list of things to consider
acquiring](#annex-d-list-of-things-to-consider-acquiring){.govuk-link}
for other things you may need to get.

### Movement around the school

Try to reduce possible contact between different groups of children, and
between adults, it may be helpful for corridors to be used on a one way
basis at any given time.

The guidance on [implementing protective measures in education and
childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings#how-to-implement-protective-measures-in-an-education-setting-before-wider-opening-on-1-june){.govuk-link}
provides more suggestions on planning things like corridor access, lunch
breaks and pick-up and drop-off times.

### Site examination

Start with an examination of the classrooms available, and any other
rooms to be used as temporary classrooms.

You may need to spread out into different classrooms or spaces than is
usually the case. If you are having to split, for example, a reception
class and use a non-reception classroom for half the class, you may need
to move some essential resources into the non-reception room, if there
is space to do so.

You should be mindful to minimise the number of resources in order to
make sure they can be wiped clean. Wherever possible, resources which
are not easily washable or wipeable should be removed.

Display the posters in [annex c](#annex-c-posters){.govuk-link} (or
others you think are suitable) in every classroom to be used, at the
main entrance or front office, in places visible to those at the school
gate if possible, in the staffroom and in all toilets.

[2. ]{.number} Reviewing your staff for availability in school
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Audit your whole staff to ascertain who will be available to be in school from the week commencing 1 June

Remember staff may need to work with different groups of children than
usual.

You may also be working with some staff who are anxious and may value
the opportunity for discussion and reassurance.

The guidance on [implementing protective measures in education and
childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}
contains information about clinically vulnerable and clinically
extremely vulnerable adults.

**Clinically extremely vulnerable individuals** are advised not to work
outside the home. We are strongly advising people, including education
staff, who are clinically extremely vulnerable (those with serious
underlying health conditions which put them at very high risk of severe
illness from coronavirus and have been advised by their clinician or
through a letter) to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to
keep themselves safe. Staff in this position are advised not to attend
work.

Read [guidance on shielding and protecting people defined on medical
grounds as extremely
vulnerable](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link}
for more advice.

**Clinically vulnerable individuals** who are at higher risk of severe
illness (for example, people with some pre-existing conditions as set
out in the [staying at home and away from others (social
distancing)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#clinically-vulnerable-people){.govuk-link}
guidance) have been advised to take extra care in observing social
distancing and should work from home where possible. This includes
pregnant women. Education and childcare settings should endeavour to
support this, for example by asking staff to support remote education,
carry out lesson planning or other roles which can be done from home.

If clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable)
individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered the safest
available on-site roles, staying 2 metres away from others wherever
possible, although the individual may choose to take on a role that does
not allow for this distance if they prefer to do so. If they have to
spend time within 2 metres of other people, settings must carefully
assess and discuss with them whether this involves an acceptable level
of risk.

If a **member of staff lives with someone who is clinically vulnerable**
(but not clinically extremely vulnerable), which includes those who are
pregnant, they can attend work.

If a **staff member lives in a household with someone who is extremely
clinically vulnerable**, as set out in the [guidance on shielding and
protecting people defined on medical grounds as extremely
vulnerable](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link},
it is advised they only attend work if stringent social distancing can
be adhered to. If stringent social distancing cannot be adhered to, we
do not expect those individuals to attend. They should be supported to
work at home.

Your staffing picture may change so you should update your audit
frequently. Ask staff to update you immediately if their situation
changes as you will need to base decisions on your most recent staff
availability audit.

#### What to consider when working out staff ratios {#section-2}

1.  How many staff do you have available to work in school?
2.  How many teachers do you have available to work in school?
3.  How many support staff including teaching assistants do you have
    available for work in school?
4.  Do you have a head or deputy available for work in school?
5.  Do you have at least one person with paediatric first aid training
    available for work in school?
6.  Do you have at least one person with up to date Designated
    Safeguarding Lead (DSL) training available to work in school?
7.  Do you have your special educational needs coordinator available for
    work, or an alternative staff member who could take on this role?
8.  Do you have a caretaker and/or cleaning staff, and if necessary at
    least one office staff member available during the school day?

If the answer to questions 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 is no, then you should try to
find a solution to this before going further. You should speak to your
local authority and/or trust who may be able to provide a suitable
person temporarily to cover 5, 6, 7 or 8. In some cases, staff members
may be prepared to undertake a different role to their normal role
temporarily.

Keep your staffing arrangements as consistent as possible. In instances
where you do need to use staff from other schools, ensure cover is
agreed on a weekly basis, not daily, to limit contacts.

[3. ]{.number} Familiarise yourself with the maximum safe group size
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We know that, unlike older children and adults, early years and primary
age children cannot be expected to remain 2 metres apart from each other
and staff. In deciding to bring more children back to early years and
schools, we are taking this into account.

You should, therefore, work through the hierarchy of measures set out in
[implementing protective measures in education and childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}:

-   avoiding contact with anyone with symptoms
-   frequent hand cleaning and good respiratory hygiene practices
-   regular cleaning of settings
-   minimising contact and mixing

It is still important to reduce contact between people as much as
possible, so children, young people and staff where possible, should
only mix in a small, consistent group and that small group should stay
away from other people and groups. If you can keep older children within
those small groups 2 metres away from each other, you should do so.
While in general groups should be kept apart, brief, transitory contact,
such as passing in a corridor, is low risk.

For primary schools, classes should normally be split in half, with no
more than 15 pupils per small group and one teacher (and, if needed, a
teaching assistant).

Vulnerable children and children of critical workers in other year
groups should also be split into small groups of no more than 15. Where
desks are used, they should be spaced as far apart as possible.

[4. ]{.number} Creating and staffing your temporary teaching groups
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have answered yes to questions 4, 5, 6 and 7 in [section
2](#section-2){.govuk-link}, and know how many teachers, teaching
assistants and other support staff you have who are available for work,
you should begin the process of working out how you can support eligible
pupils.

In so doing you should:

-   assume all eligible children will attend for the purposes of the
    first stage of planning, even if you think that is unlikely - that
    includes ensuring you follow the [attendance expectations for
    vulnerable
    children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people#attendance-expectations-and-encouraging-attendance){.govuk-link}
-   determine your half class groups (maximum size of 15), taking into
    account any limitations of your school buildings and outdoor space
    (see [implementing protective measures in education and childcare
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings#class-or-group-sizes){.govuk-link}
    for more details)
-   include children of critical workers and vulnerable children who are
    in reception, year 1 or 6 in groups of 15 within their year group
-   determine your small groups (maximum size of 15) of children of
    critical workers and vulnerable children not in reception or years 1
    and 6
-   assume that the staffing model will be one teacher per group (or 2
    teachers sharing the week if you have existing job shares) -
    qualified teachers are qualified to teach any primary year group,
    including early years foundation stage (EYFS)
-   if there are any shortages of teachers then teaching assistants can
    be allocated to lead a group, working under the direction of a
    teacher

As a result of this exercise, and in the light of your staffing audit
and the school premises, you will know if you can cater for all eligible
children, including children of critical workers and vulnerable children
of all ages.

If you do not have the staff available to be able to cover all the new
teaching groups you have created, and this may be more likely for infant
schools, you will need to consider possible solutions with your local
authority and/or trust.

Possible approaches to managing a shortfall in staffing include:

-   bringing additional teachers in to help, who may be supply teachers,
    teachers on temporary agreed loan from other schools, or teachers
    provided by your trust or local authority (considering the guidance
    in [section
    2](#reviewing-your-staff-for-availability-in-school){.govuk-link}
    about consistent staffing across the week)
-   asking suitably experienced teaching assistants who are willing to
    do so to work with groups under the supervision of a teacher
-   using some senior leadership time to cover groups, although you
    should as headteacher consider your own workload and that of your
    senior colleagues to make sure this is manageable and you have
    sufficient leadership time remaining

We trust headteachers to make the best decisions they can. If you still
cannot get enough cover in place and an arrangement which enables
eligible children to attend consistently at another local school is not
manageable, schools should focus first on continuing to provide places
for priority groups of all year groups (children of critical workers and
vulnerable children). Then, to support children’s early learning, you
should prioritise groups of children as follows:

-   early years settings - 3 and 4 year olds followed by younger age
    groups
-   infant schools - nursery (where applicable) and reception
-   primary schools - nursery (where applicable), reception and year 1

Schools should not plan on the basis of a rota system, either daily or
weekly.

### Attendance reporting

Prepare to resume taking the attendance register and continue completing
the daily data returns using the DfE portal (further guidance on what
attendance and absence codes to use at this time will be published
shortly).

You should also prepare to continue with any arrangements that have been
made with the local authority with the aim of safeguarding vulnerable
children.

Parents and carers of eligible year groups, and critical workers/parents
and carers of vulnerable children, are strongly encouraged to bring in
their children, [but they will not face fines or other sanctions if they
don’t](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-and-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020){.govuk-link}.

Your school will not be held to account for your attendance figures
during this time.

You should encourage parents whose children have been invited in to call
you each day if they are not coming in as normal, so you understand why
and can discuss it with them if needed.

[5. ]{.number} Practical steps to reduce risk
---------------------------------------------

You should plan for putting in place protective measures to reduce
risks, for example by adjusting timings of the school day and agreeing
this with the relevant body (such as your governing board). The
overriding aim here is to reduce contact between different groups.

You should consider steps including:

-   how you might stagger start and end times between year groups by a
    short period to reduce volume at the entrance
-   ensuring parents and carers are aware of recommendations on
    transport to and from school, which means reducing any unnecessary
    travel on coaches, buses or public transport where possible (for
    example, by walking or cycling to school) and avoiding peak times
-   using signage to guide parents and carers about where and when they
    should drop off and pick up their children - you will want to
    communicate this to parents in advance
-   working out arrangements for breaks or play times so that ideally
    only one group of maximum 15 children is in the same play area at
    any one time
-   ensuring that staff remain at a safe distance from each other at
    lunchtime or during breaks (including how to manage if your school
    has a small staff room or other staff areas)
-   arranging for assemblies to take place with individual groups in
    their allocated classroom spaces rather than bringing children from
    different classes together into one hall or large space

You should also consider working with your catering supplier and kitchen
staff on arrangements for lunchtime. Children in reception and year 1
should have the option of a free meal under the universal infant free
school meals policy. Meals should be available for all pupils in school,
and these should also be free of charge for pupils that qualify for
benefits-related free school meals. With your kitchen staff, you will
need to consider how meals will be prepared and served safely. Plans
will need to be in place to ensure food supplies are in place for when
children return.

Work out arrangements for lunch (and any ‘snack’ times for early years)
so that children do not mix with children from other groups – this could
mean having several lunch sittings or serving lunch in more than one
location, including if appropriate in a classroom, or asking your
caterers to look at other flexible ways of giving pupils access to lunch
such that it can be eaten in the small group setting (for example taking
cold or ‘packed’ lunches to children in the areas they are in for the
day).

[6. ]{.number} External support for SEND and behaviour
------------------------------------------------------

Schools may normally work with external agencies to support pupils with
special educational needs and disability (SEND) or with behaviour or
other issues. Headteachers should check with local authorities or other
providers of such support services to ascertain whether or when such
services will be available. For pupils with education health and care
(EHC) plans, it may not be possible to provide the full range of
provision set out in the plan, and it may be necessary to make different
arrangements if some of the support services are not available in their
usual form from the start of June. If this is the case you should work
with the local authority and parents, and confirm what special provision
can reasonably be provided.

We have published guidance on [conducting a SEND risk assessment during
the coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-send-risk-assessment-guidance){.govuk-link}
– this will be reviewed ahead of 1 June.

Headteachers should also be aware that there may be additional pupils,
including those with SEND, who display symptoms of stress or anxiety and
additional support may be needed for them. Schools should check with
local authorities on their capacity to support with this.

[7. ]{.number} Changes to routines for staff and pupils
-------------------------------------------------------

Ahead of opening for more pupils, schools will need to update their
behaviour policy to reflect the new rules and routines, and communicate
these changes to staff, pupils and parents.

Think about if and how your school rules need to change. There are some
example new school rules given in [annex
a](#annex-a-behaviour-principles){.govuk-link} which you could adopt or
adapt. Any revised rules will need to be referenced in the revised
behaviour policy with sanctions.

Consider how the new rules and routines will be communicated to pupils
and parents/carers. Best practice suggests this includes:

-   proactively teaching new rules to staff, pupils and parents
-   regularly and rigorously reinforcing behaviour throughout every day
-   consistently imposing sanctions when rules are broken, in line with
    the policy, as well as positively reinforcing well-executed rules
    through encouragement and rewards

Display the posters in [annex c](#annex-c-posters){.govuk-link}, which
are suitable for reception, years 1 and 6.

Prepare guidance for staff (see a model in [annex
b](#annex-b-principles-for-staff){.govuk-link}) and ensure all staff are
trained in the new rules and routines, including the use of sanctions
and rewards, so that they can support pupils to understand them and
enforce them consistently.

Staff will need to explicitly teach and supervise health and hygiene
arrangements such as handwashing, tissue disposal and toilet flushing.

### Taking books home

Limit the number of shared resources that are taken home by staff and
pupils and limit the exchange of such resources.

Teachers should make sure they wash their hands and surfaces, before and
after handling pupils’ books.

### Uniform

There is no need for anything other than normal personal hygiene and
washing of clothes following a day in a school. Uniform that cannot be
machine washed should be avoided.

You will want to think about leeway for any child who has grown out of
any parts of their uniform since March but whose parents cannot
currently replace it.

### Drop off and pick up routines

Changes to drop off and pick up routines will be required. You should
tell parents when they can drop off their children and that this should
happen at the school gate.

You should determine a queuing system and a process for staff to greet
each child, ensure they wash their hands immediately on arrival, and
then go straight to their classroom.

Schools should inform parents that this is to reduce the number of
people on the school site in the interest of infection control. If it is
customary for parents to gather in the playground or to enter the
buildings to drop off or collect children this should no longer be
allowed, and neither should any gathering at the school gates to talk to
other parents.

### Visitors

Limit the external visitors to the school during school hours.

Parents should come into school buildings only when strictly necessary,
by appointment, and ideally only one (unless for example, an interpreter
or other support is required). Any such meetings should take place at a
safe distance (and so the use of small offices may not be suitable).

[8. ]{.number} Communicating with staff
---------------------------------------

Undertake an online staff meeting before wider opening from the week
commencing 1 June, to take staff through arrangements if possible.

Ensure you or senior colleagues are free to be present around the school
especially during the early part of wider opening. Staff and pupils may
require additional support and reassurance, and you will be more easily
available to pick up on any issues or problems.

Arrange regular opportunities to get feedback from staff on the new
arrangements.

[9. ]{.number} Communicating with parents
-----------------------------------------

You should communicate with parents to make sure they know :

-   whether their child will be able to attend from the week commencing
    1 June
-   what protective steps you’re taking to make the school a low-risk
    place for their child
-   what you need them to do (such as on drop off and collection)

A model letter will be available shortly on preparing for the wider
opening of schools from 1 June, which you can use if useful and adapt as
you wish.

You may also want to consider senior leaders calling parents in eligible
groups to discuss with them directly, where this is feasible.

[10. ]{.number} Managing pupil and staff wellbeing and mental health
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The coronavirus outbreak may have caused significant mental health or
wellbeing difficulties for some children. It is important to recognise
that while ‘getting back to normal’ is important and will be reassuring
for many, school staff will need to consider how to support:

-   individual children who have found the long period at home hard to
    manage
-   those who have developed anxieties related to the virus
-   those about whom there are safeguarding concerns
-   those who may make safeguarding disclosures once they are back in
    schools

Some children may also have experienced bereavements in their immediate
family or wider circle of friends or family or had increased/new caring
responsibilities.

All children will have missed the routine of school, seeing their
friends, and being supported by their teachers and other adults in the
school.

Staff may wish to provide:

-   opportunities for children to talk about their experiences of the
    past few weeks
-   opportunities for one-to-one conversations with trusted adults where
    this may be supportive
-   some refocussed lessons on relevant topics, for example, mental
    wellbeing or staying safe
-   pastoral activity, such as positive opportunities to renew and
    develop friendships and peer groups
-   other enriching developmental activities

As part of the introduction of health education during 2020 to 2021, we
are producing some training materials for teachers on teaching about
mental wellbeing and these may be a useful source of information for
teachers and headteachers.

The different experiences all pupils will have had at home will
naturally play a large part in how easily they re-adapt to attending
school and its routines. Staff will need to strike an appropriate
balance between reintegrating pupils into a reassuring and familiar work
ethic to support their mental wellbeing on the one hand, and identifying
and taking time to address explicitly individual concerns or problems on
the other.

If safeguarding issues come to light, they should be addressed using the
school’s safeguarding policy, which may need to be updated in light of
wider opening. Headteachers should consider how they might manage any
increase in referrals as pupils return to school.

Alongside this, governing boards and school leaders should consider the
mental health and wellbeing of staff (including school leaders
themselves), and the need to implement flexible working practices in a
way that promotes good work-life balance for teachers and leaders.

[11. ]{.number} Planning what to teach, and how
-----------------------------------------------

The priorities for young children at this time are resocialisation into
new style school routines, speaking and listening, and regaining
momentum in particular with early reading.

Each school context will vary and needs are likely to be greatest where
children have not been able to access remote education consistently.
Children who have had limited opportunities for exercise should be
encouraged to exert themselves physically, making use of supervised
non-touch running games within their group. The [Association for
PE](https://www.afpe.org.uk/){.govuk-link} and the [Youth Sport
Trust](https://www.youthsporttrust.org/news/update-coronavirus-covid-19){.govuk-link}
are also offering some support to schools.

For younger children, the resources made available for child-initiated
learning should be carefully considered. For example, malleable
resources, such as play dough, should not be shared and consideration
should be given to their safe use, depending on circumstances.

Resources for activities such as painting, sticking, cutting, small
world play, indoor and outdoor construction activities should be washed
before and after use (more detailed guidance on this will be included in
the guide for early years providers) and where possible, children should
be discouraged from sharing these.

Children should be taught to wash their hands frequently, but
particularly after using wheeled bikes, trikes and other large, movable
toys. Children should be encouraged where possible not to touch their
faces or to put objects in their mouths. Sharing stories, singing and
playing outdoor games will help all children to socialise and resettle
into familiar everyday classroom routines.

We have amended legislation to allow for the temporary disapplying and
modifying of a number of requirements within the early years foundation
stage (EYFS), which covers children in reception, giving settings
flexibility to respond to changes in workforce availability and
potential fluctuations in demand. These temporary changes came into
force on 24 April 2020. During the coronavirus outbreak, schools should
use reasonable endeavours to meet the existing [EYFS learning and
development
requirements](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2/early-years-foundation-stage-coronavirus-disapplications){.govuk-link}.
As far as possible, children should benefit from a broad range of
educational opportunities, but this also provides schools with the
flexibility to give additional focus to fundamental areas where support
is required following time spent out of school, such as reading.

For year 1, where possible schools should ascertain where children have
fallen behind or have progressed further against the school’s existing
reading curriculum. If they have forgotten aspects already covered, then
reteach and practise this material, where necessary reteaching phonics
and using appropriately matched reading books to practise reading. Where
there are small numbers significantly behind others then ensure they
receive support as intensively as can be managed to catch up, and liaise
where possible with parents and carers to ensure they can support too.

In year 6 it is unlikely that many of the end of term traditions will be
able to take place, for example, whole year or class assemblies with
parents, school journeys and trips. Schools should provide opportunities
for children to discuss this as it may be a source of anxiety or
sadness. Though visits to secondary schools for induction will not take
place this year, some secondary schools may have capacity to undertake
remote induction briefings or other types of sessions for pupils, for
example to meet form tutors, heads of year, or other key staff, or have
a tour of the school virtually. You should discuss the options with your
secondary schools.

Primary schools should, if not already in hand, ensure that information
is transferred to destination secondary schools as soon as possible, and
if practical in the absence of SATs results ensure that secondary
schools are briefed in as much detail as possible about the attainment
profile of transferring pupils, along with other information normally
transferred.

Year 6 teaching during this time should focus on readiness for secondary
school, including academic readiness, which could involve additional
teaching in any subject, but in particular mathematics and English to
make up for any losses to learning incurred while at home.

Physical education lessons may continue to take place providing they are
strictly non-contact and do not involve more than any one temporary
group.

[12. ]{.number} Remote education during wider opening
-----------------------------------------------------

Many schools will have been able to offer high-quality remote education
opportunities or programmes over recent weeks. Now that primary schools
will be opening more widely, larger numbers of staff will be needed to
provide face-to-face teaching at school. This means that it may be more
difficult to maintain the same level of remote education provision for
pupils in the year groups who are not eligible to attend, or for those
pupils in year groups who are eligible to attend but who themselves
cannot.

In these circumstances consider how Oak National Academy or other remote
education platforms can provide additional support for learning, as well
as how learning delivered in school, if manageable, could be made
available to pupils learning remotely.

Equal consideration should also be given to pupils who do not have
suitable online access and where possible would benefit from printed
resources.

We have produced guidance on [remote education during the coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19){.govuk-link},
including an initial list of educational resources and case studies.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### What if for example, my year 1 teacher(s) cannot come into school, but my year 2 teacher(s) can? Is it OK to invite year 2 children to school instead of year 1 children?

No. Only pupils in the eligible years (reception, years 1 and 6) plus
vulnerable children and children of critical workers should come in to
school from the week commencing 1 June. You should support your year 2
teacher(s) to teach the year 1 class(es), or ask the year 1 teacher(s)
to set the work, or teach via video link, while another adult, for
example, your year 2 teacher(s), supervises the class. Any qualified
teacher is qualified to teach any year group in a primary school,
including reception.

### We normally run breakfast and after school clubs as part of our ‘wrap-around’ provision. Are we required to re-start them? {#we-normally-run-breakfast-and-after-school-clubs-as-part-of-our-wrap-around-provision--are-we-required-to-re-start-them}

No, you are not required to do so. You should only run such provision if
you are able to keep children within the groups they are in during the
day or safely distanced.

### We have worked through this document and are ready to extend our opening from week commencing 1 June. Do I need to convene a meeting of my governing body to secure their agreement? Do I need to tell the local authority or the diocese? {#we-have-worked-through-this-document-and-are-ready-to-extend-our-opening-from-week-commencing-1-june-do-i-need-to-convene-a-meeting-of-my-governing-body-to-secure-their-agreement-do-i-need-to-tell-the-local-authority-or-the-diocese}

Throughout each stage of this process, it is important to consult
members of staff and governors to gain their involvement and support.
You should keep your appropriate authority (who may be your governing
body, trust board or local authority) informed of arrangements being
made and key strategic decisions should be taken by them. This process
can provide very helpful support for headteachers.

### Some parents have children in, for example, reception and year 1 so staged start times are not practical for them. What should I do? {#some-parents-have-children-in-for-example-reception-and-year-1-so-staged-start-times-are-not-practical-for-them-what-should-i-do}

You are encouraged to contact parents where this is the case and agree a
start time for both or all children concerned. A model letter will be
available shortly on preparing for the wider opening of schools from 1
June, which you can use if useful and adapt as you wish.

### What if parents do not observe social distancing at the school gate? Is it my job to enforce social distancing outside the school gates?

It is likely to be helpful to parents for you to explain clearly what
the arrangements are for the start and end of the school day, and
decisions you make about this should allow for the need for social
distancing outside the school. Clear communication, including if
possible or appropriate, through signage, can be helpful. Reminders may
be useful as well from time to time.

### Some of my staff have asked to have masks, gloves and aprons. Am I required to provide them? {#some-of-my-staff-have-asked-to-have-masks-gloves-and-aprons-am-i-required-to-provide-them}

We have published guidance on [implementing protective measures in
education and childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
The guidance states that it is not necessary for staff to wear masks,
gloves and aprons unless they are carrying out activities that would
usually require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) or if a
child, young person or other learner becomes unwell with symptoms of
coronavirus while in their setting and needs supervision until they can
return home.

You should use your local supply chains to obtain PPE. Where this is not
possible, and there is an unmet urgent need for PPE in order to operate
safely, you may approach your nearest local resilience forum.

### Can I direct staff to come into school?

It is natural that some staff will be worried about coming into school
even if the risks for them are very low. You will know your staff best
and so will be in the best position to work out how to proceed in
individual cases. We are working in an unprecedented context, and more
reassurance and discussion than usual may be required. It is always
best, if at all possible, to work out a sensible way forward in
individual cases that acknowledges any specific anxieties but which also
enables the school’s responsibilities to be effectively discharged. If
you need support in finding a solution, speak to your local authority or
trust.

Annex A: Behaviour principles
-----------------------------

In light of the need for children to behave differently when they return
to school, and any new systems you have put in place to support that,
you’ll need to make changes to your behaviour policy. Behaviour policy
changes will also need to be communicated to pupils, parents and staff.

Areas schools may wish to add to their behaviour policy are:

-   following any altered routines for arrival or departure
-   following school instructions on hygiene, such as handwashing and
    sanitising
-   following instructions on who pupils can socialise with at school
-   moving around the school as per specific instructions (for example,
    one-way systems, out of bounds areas, queuing)
-   expectations about sneezing, coughing, tissues and disposal (‘catch
    it, bin it, kill it’) and avoiding touching your mouth, nose and
    eyes with hands
-   tell an adult if you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus
-   rules about sharing any equipment or other items including drinking
    bottles
-   amended expectations about breaks or play times, including where
    children may or may not play
-   use of toilets
-   clear rules about coughing or spitting at or towards any other
    person
-   clear rules for pupils at home about conduct in relation to remote
    education
-   rewards and sanction system where appropriate

Identify any reasonable adjustments that need to be made for students
with more challenging behaviour.

Annex B: Principles for staff
-----------------------------

1.  Do not come to work if you have coronavirus symptoms, or go home as
    soon as these develop (informing your manager), and access a test as
    soon as possible.
2.  Clean your hands more often than usual - with running water and soap
    and dry them thoroughly or use alcohol hand rub or sanitiser
    ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.
3.  Use the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach.
4.  Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes.
5.  Clean frequently touched surfaces often using standard products,
    such as detergents and bleach.
6.  Think about ways to modify your teaching approach to keep a distance
    from children in your class as much as possible, particularly close
    face to face support (noting that it’s understood that this is not
    possible at all times, which is why hygiene and hand cleaning is so
    important).
7.  Consider avoiding calling pupils to the front of the class or going
    to their desk to check on their work if not necessary.
8.  Help your class to follow the rules on hand cleaning, not touching
    their faces, ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ etc. including by updating
    your classrooms displays with posters.
9.  Prevent your class from sharing equipment and resources (like
    stationery).
10. Keep your classroom door and windows open if possible for air flow.
11. Limit the number of children from your class using the toilet at any
    one time.
12. Limit your contact with other staff members, and don’t congregate in
    shared spaces, especially if they are small rooms.
13. Make sure you’ve read the school’s updated behaviour policy and know
    what role in it you’re being asked to take.

Annex D: List of things to consider acquiring
---------------------------------------------

This might include:

-   posters (for example, to encourage consistency on hygiene and
    keeping to own group)
-   soap for sinks, and where there is no sink nearby, hand sanitiser in
    rooms/learning environments
-   disposable paper towels
-   cleaning products
-   sanitising wipes for wiping some equipment
-   lidded bins
-   tape for cordoning off areas and marking floors
