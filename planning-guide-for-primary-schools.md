    We have made updates to the 'tracing close contacts and isolation’,
    'face coverings', 'stepping measures up and down’ and ‘travel and
    quarantine’ sections.

2.  19 July 2021

    We have updated the schools COVID-19 operational guidance to reflect
    that we moved to Step 4 on 19 July. This includes removing the

    operational guidance (applies until Step 4)’ and ‘Annex A: health
    and safety risk assessment’. We have also updated sections on
    clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) children and CEV staff.

3.  14 July 2021

    Updated to clarify that, from 19 July, government is removing the

    also includes information about updating your outbreak management
    plan and what to do when an individual in your school tests positive
