Background
----------

As a result of the huge efforts everyone has made to adhere to strict
social distancing measures, the transmission rate of coronavirus
(COVID-19) has decreased. We therefore anticipate, with further
progress, that we may be able, from the week commencing 1 June, to
welcome back more children to early years, school and further education
settings. We will only do this provided that the 5 key tests set by
government justify the changes at the time, including that the rate of
infection is decreasing and the enabling programmes set out in the
roadmap are operating effectively. As a result we are asking schools,
colleges and childcare providers to plan on this basis, ahead of
confirmation that these tests are met.

Education and childcare settings are already open to priority groups
([vulnerable
children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people){.govuk-link}
and children of [critical
workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision){.govuk-link})^[1](#fn:1){.govuk-link}^.
Now that we have made progress in reducing the transmission of
coronavirus we are encouraging all eligible children to attend - it is
no longer necessary for parents of eligible children to keep them at
home if they can. In particular, as per the existing [Supporting
vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19)
outbreak
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people){.govuk-link},
vulnerable children of all year groups continue to be expected and
encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for
them to do so.

From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking
primary schools to welcome back children in nursery, reception, year 1
and year 6, alongside priority groups. We will ask secondary schools,
sixth form and further education colleges to offer some face-to-face
support to supplement the remote education of year 10 and year 12
students who are due to take key exams next year, alongside the full
time provision they are offering to priority groups.

We are also asking nurseries and other early years providers, including
childminders, to begin welcoming back all children. Alternative
provision settings should mirror the approach being taken for mainstream
schools and also offer some face-to-face support for years 10 and 11
students (as they have no year 12). Special schools, special post-16
institutions and hospital schools will work towards a phased return of
more children and young people without a focus on specific year groups.

We want to get all children and young people back into education as soon
as the scientific advice allows because it is the best place for them to
learn, and because we know how important it is for their mental
wellbeing to have social interactions with their peers, carers and
teachers. Children returning to educational and childcare settings in
greater numbers will also allow more families to return to work.

We are therefore gradually increasing the numbers of children and young
people attending schools and colleges. This decision is based on the
latest scientific advice. By returning pupils gradually, settings can
initially reduce the number of children and young people in classrooms
compared to usual and put protective measures in place to reduce risks.

In childcare settings, providers will be asked to welcome back all
children below statutory school age from the week commencing 1 June.
Demand for childcare is likely to be lower than usual at first, and
existing space requirements and staff to child ratios for these age
groups should allow for small group working. Where the physical layout
of a setting does not allow small groups of children to be kept at a
safe distance apart, we expect practitioners to exercise judgement in
ensuring the highest standards of safety are maintained. In some cases,
it may be necessary for providers to introduce a temporary cap on
numbers to ensure that safety is prioritised. From 1 June, childminders
can look after children of all ages, in line with usual limits on the
number of children they can care for.

Our ambition is to bring all primary year groups back to school before
the summer holidays, for a month if feasible, though this will be kept
under review. We will only welcome back additional year groups if the
most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus indicates it
is appropriate to have larger numbers of children within schools. The
safety of children and staff is our utmost priority.

This advice seeks to support staff working in schools, colleges and
childcare settings, to deliver this approach in the safest way possible,
focusing on measures they can put in place to help limit risk of the
virus spreading within education and childcare settings. At the point
that we think it is appropriate for more children and young people to
return to schools and colleges, we will revise this guidance.

We will be publishing more detailed guidance on the operation of early
years settings shortly.

Settings operating between now and 1 June should read this guidance in
conjunction with [Actions for schools during the coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-school-closures){.govuk-link}.

This advice will be updated as required.

Effective infection protection and control
------------------------------------------

There are important actions that children and young people, their
parents and those who work with them can take during the coronavirus
outbreak, to help prevent the spread of the virus.

In all education, childcare and social care settings, preventing the
spread of coronavirus involves dealing with direct transmission (for
instance, when in close contact with those sneezing and coughing) and
indirect transmission (via touching contaminated surfaces). A range of
approaches and actions should be employed to do this. These can be seen
as a hierarchy of controls that, when implemented, creates an inherently
safer system, where the risk of transmission of infection is
substantially reduced. These include:

-   minimising contact with individuals who are unwell by ensuring that
    those who have coronavirus symptoms, or who have someone in their
    household who does, do not attend childcare settings, schools or
    colleges
-   cleaning hands more often than usual - wash hands thoroughly for 20
    seconds with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly or use
    alcohol hand rub or sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands
    are covered
-   ensuring good respiratory hygiene by promoting the ‘catch it, bin
    it, kill it’ approach
-   cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products,
    such as detergents and bleach
-   minimising contact and mixing by altering, as much as possible, the
    environment (such as classroom layout) and timetables (such as
    staggered break times)

Personal protective equipment (PPE) including face coverings and face masks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wearing a face covering or face mask in schools or other education
settings is not recommended. Face coverings may be beneficial for short
periods indoors where there is a risk of close social contact with
people you do not usually meet and where social distancing and other
measures cannot be maintained, for example on public transport or in
some shops. This does not apply to schools or other education settings.
Schools and other education or childcare settings should therefore not
require staff, children and learners to wear face coverings. Changing
habits, cleaning and hygiene are effective measures in controlling the
spread of the virus. Face coverings (or any form of medical mask where
instructed to be used for specific clinical reasons) should not be worn
in any circumstance by those who may not be able to handle them as
directed (for example, young children, or those with special educational
needs or disabilities) as it may inadvertently increase the risk of
transmission.

The majority of staff in education settings will not require PPE beyond
what they would normally need for their work, even if they are not
always able to maintain a distance of 2 metres from others. PPE is only
needed in a very small number of cases including:

-   children, young people and students whose care routinely already
    involves the use of PPE due to their intimate care needs should
    continue to receive their care in the same way
-   if a child, young person or other learner becomes unwell with
    symptoms of coronavirus while in their setting and needs direct
    personal care until they can return home. A fluid-resistant surgical
    face mask should be worn by the supervising adult if a distance of 2
    metres cannot be maintained. If contact with the child or young
    person is necessary, then disposable gloves, a disposable apron and
    a fluid-resistant surgical face mask should be worn by the
    supervising adult. If a risk assessment determines that there is a
    risk of splashing to the eyes, for example from coughing, spitting,
    or vomiting, then eye protection should also be worn

Education, childcare and children’s social care settings and providers
should use their local supply chains to obtain PPE. Where this is not
possible, and there is unmet urgent need for PPE in order to operate
safely, they may approach their nearest local resilience forum.

Read the guidance on [safe working in education, childcare and
children’s social
care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care){.govuk-link}
for more information about preventing and controlling infection,
including the use of PPE.

Shielded and clinically vulnerable children and young people
------------------------------------------------------------

For the vast majority of children and young people, coronavirus is a
mild illness. Children and young people (0 to 18 years of age) who have
been [classed as clinically extremely vulnerable due to pre-existing
medical
conditions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-on-protecting-people-most-likely-to-get-unwell-from-coronavirus-shielding-young-peoples-version){.govuk-link}
have been advised to shield. We do not expect these children to be
attending school or college, and they should continue to be supported at
home as much as possible. Clinically vulnerable (but not clinically
extremely vulnerable) people are those considered to be at a higher risk
of severe illness from coronavirus. A small minority of children will
fall into this category, and parents should follow medical advice if
their child is in this category.

Shielded and clinically vulnerable adults
-----------------------------------------

Clinically extremely vulnerable individuals are advised not to work
outside the home. We are strongly advising people, including education
staff, who are clinically extremely vulnerable (those with serious
underlying health conditions which put them at very high risk of severe
illness from coronavirus and have been advised by their clinician or
through a letter) to rigorously follow shielding measures in order to
keep themselves safe. Staff in this position are advised not to attend
work. Read [COVID-19: guidance on shielding and protecting people
defined on medical grounds as extremely
vulnerable](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link}
for more advice.

Clinically vulnerable individuals who are at higher risk of severe
illness (for example, people with some pre-existing conditions as set
out in the [Staying at home and away from others (social distancing)
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#clinically-vulnerable-people){.govuk-link}
have been advised to take extra care in observing social distancing and
should work from home where possible. Education and childcare settings
should endeavour to support this, for example by asking staff to support
remote education, carry out lesson planning or other roles which can be
done from home. If clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely
vulnerable) individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered
the safest available on-site roles, staying 2 metres away from others
wherever possible, although the individual may choose to take on a role
that does not allow for this distance if they prefer to do so. If they
have to spend time within 2 metres of other people, settings must
carefully assess and discuss with them whether this involves an
acceptable level of risk.

Living with a shielded or clinically vulnerable person
------------------------------------------------------

If a child, young person or a member of staff lives with someone who is
clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable),
including those who are pregnant, they can attend their education or
childcare setting.

If a child, young person or staff member lives in a household with
someone who is extremely clinically vulnerable, as set out in the
[COVID-19: guidance on shielding and protecting people defined on
medical grounds as extremely vulnerable
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link},
it is advised they only attend an education or childcare setting if
stringent social distancing can be adhered to and, in the case of
children, they are able to understand and follow those instructions.
This may not be possible for very young children and older children
without the capacity to adhere to the instructions on social distancing.
If stringent social distancing cannot be adhered to, we do not expect
those individuals to attend. They should be supported to learn or work
at home.

Class or group sizes
--------------------

We know that, unlike older children and adults, early years and primary
age children cannot be expected to remain 2 metres apart from each other
and staff. In deciding to bring more children back to early years and
schools, we are taking this into account. Schools should therefore work
through the hierarchy of measures set out above:

-   avoiding contact with anyone with symptoms
-   frequent hand cleaning and good respiratory hygiene practices
-   regular cleaning of settings
-   minimising contact and mixing

It is still important to reduce contact between people as much as
possible, and we can achieve that and reduce transmission risk by
ensuring children, young people and staff where possible, only mix in a
small, consistent group and that small group stays away from other
people and groups.

Public Health England (PHE) is clear that if early years settings,
schools and colleges do this, and crucially if they are also applying
regular hand cleaning, hygiene and cleaning measures and handling
potential cases of the virus as per the advice, then the risk of
transmission will be lowered.

Where settings can keep children and young people in those small groups
2 metres away from each other, they should do so. While in general
groups should be kept apart, brief, transitory contact, such as passing
in a corridor, is low risk.

For pre-school children in early years settings, the staff to child
ratios within [Early Years Foundation
Stage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2){.govuk-link}
(EYFS) continue to apply as set out here, and we recommend using these
to group children.

For primary schools, classes should normally be split in half, with no
more than 15 pupils per small group and one teacher (and, if needed, a
teaching assistant). If there are any shortages of teachers, then
teaching assistants can be allocated to lead a group, working under the
direction of a teacher. Vulnerable children and children of critical
workers in other year groups should also be split into small groups of
no more than 15. Desks should be spaced as far apart as possible.

For secondary schools and colleges, the same principle of halving
classes will normally apply. It is also sensible to rearrange classrooms
and workshops with sitting positions 2 metres apart. Where very small
classes might result from halving, it would be acceptable to have more
than half in a class, provided the space has been rearranged. Again,
support staff may be drawn on in the event there are teacher shortages,
working under the direction of other teachers in the setting.

Each setting’s circumstances will be slightly different. Any setting
that cannot achieve these small groups at any point should discuss
options with their local authority or trust. This might be because there
are not enough classrooms or spaces available in the setting or because
they do not have enough available teachers or staff to supervise the
groups. Solutions might involve children attending a nearby school. If
necessary, settings have the flexibility to focus first on continuing to
provide places for priority groups and then, to support children’s early
learning, settings should prioritise groups of children as follows:

-   early years settings - 3 and 4 year olds followed by younger age
    groups
-   infant schools - nursery (where applicable) and reception
-   primary schools - nursery (where applicable), reception and year 1

We will revisit this advice when the science indicates it is safe to
invite more children back to schools and colleges.

How to implement protective measures in an education setting before wider opening on 1 June
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Planning and organising

Consider the following steps:

-   refresh your risk assessment and other health and safety advice for
    children, young people and staff in light of recent government
    advice, identifying protective measures (such as the things listed
    below). Also ensure that all health and safety compliance checks
    have been undertaken before opening
-   organise small class groups, as described in the ‘class or group
    sizes’ section above
-   organise classrooms and other learning environments such as
    workshops and science labs for those groups, maintaining space
    between seats and desks where possible
-   refresh the timetable:
    -   decide which lessons or activities will be delivered
    -   consider which lessons or classroom activities could take place
        outdoors
    -   use the timetable and selection of classroom or other learning
        environment to reduce movement around the school or building
    -   stagger assembly groups
    -   stagger break times (including lunch), so that all children are
        not moving around the school at the same time
    -   stagger drop-off and collection times
    -   for secondary schools and colleges, consider how best to
        supplement remote education with some face to face support for
        students
    -   plan parents’ drop-off and pick-up protocols that minimise adult
        to adult contact
-   in addition, childcare settings or early years groups in school
    should:
    -   consider how to keep small groups of children together
        throughout the day and to avoid larger groups of children mixing
    -   consider how play equipment is used ensuring it is appropriately
        cleaned between groups of children using it, and that multiple
        groups do not use it simultaneously
-   remove unnecessary items from classrooms and other learning
    environments where there is space to store it elsewhere
-   remove soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean
    (such as those with intricate parts)
-   consider how children and young people arrive at the education or
    childcare setting, and reduce any unnecessary travel on coaches,
    buses or public transport where possible. Read the [Coronavirus
    (COVID-19): safer travel guidance for
    passengers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers){.govuk-link}
-   institutions offering residential provision will also need to
    consider the maximum number of children or young people they can
    safely accommodate in residences

### Communicating your plans

Consider the following steps:

-   tell children, young people, parents, carers or any visitors, such
    as suppliers, not to enter the education or childcare setting if
    they are displaying any symptoms of coronavirus (following the
    [COVID-19: guidance for households with possible coronavirus
    infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link})
-   tell parents that if their child needs to be accompanied to the
    education or childcare setting, only one parent should attend
-   tell parents and young people their allocated drop off and
    collection times and the process for doing so, including protocols
    for minimising adult to adult contact (for example, which entrance
    to use)
-   make clear to parents that they cannot gather at entrance gates or
    doors, or enter the site (unless they have a pre-arranged
    appointment, which should be conducted safely)
-   also think about engaging parents and children in education
    resources such as [e-bug](https://www.e-bug.eu/){.govuk-link} and
    [PHE schools
    resources](https://campaignresources.phe.gov.uk/schools){.govuk-link}
-   ensure parents and young people are aware of recommendations on
    transport to and from education or childcare setting (including
    avoiding peak times). Read the [Coronavirus (COVID-19): safer travel
    guidance for
    passengers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers){.govuk-link}
-   talk to staff about the plans (for example, safety measures,
    timetable changes and staggered arrival and departure times),
    including discussing whether training would be helpful
-   communicate early with contractors and suppliers that will need to
    prepare to support your plans for opening for example, cleaning,
    catering, food supplies, hygiene suppliers
-   discuss with cleaning contractors or staff the additional cleaning
    requirements and agree additional hours to allow for this

When open
---------

Keep cohorts together where possible and:

-   ensure that children and young people are in the same small groups
    at all times each day, and different groups are not mixed during the
    day, or on subsequent days
-   ensure that the same teacher(s) and other staff are assigned to each
    group and, as far as possible, these stay the same during the day
    and on subsequent days, recognising for secondary and college
    settings there will be some subject specialist rotation of staff
-   ensure that wherever possible children and young people use the same
    classroom or area of a setting throughout the day, with a thorough
    cleaning of the rooms at the end of the day. In schools and
    colleges, you may want to consider seating students at the same desk
    each day if they attend on consecutive days

For cleaning and hygiene:

-   follow the [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings
    guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}
-   ensure that sufficient handwashing facilities are available. Where a
    sink is not nearby, provide hand sanitiser in classrooms and other
    learning environments
-   clean surfaces that children and young people are touching, such as
    toys, books, desks, chairs, doors, sinks, toilets, light switches,
    bannisters, more regularly than normal
-   ensure that all adults and children:
    -   frequently wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds
        and dry thoroughly. Review the [guidance on hand
        cleaning](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public){.govuk-link}
    -   clean their hands on arrival at the setting, before and after
        eating, and after sneezing or coughing
    -   are encouraged not to touch their mouth, eyes and nose
    -   use a tissue or elbow to cough or sneeze and use bins for tissue
        waste (‘catch it, bin it, kill it’)
-   ensure that help is available for children and young people who have
    trouble cleaning their hands independently
-   consider how to encourage young children to learn and practise these
    habits through games, songs and repetition
-   ensure that bins for tissues are emptied throughout the day
-   where possible, all spaces should be well ventilated using natural
    ventilation (opening windows) or ventilation units
-   prop doors open, where safe to do so (bearing in mind fire safety
    and safeguarding), to limit use of door handles and aid ventilation
-   get in touch with public sector buying organisation partners (for
    example ESPO, YPO, NEPO) about proportionate supplies of soap,
    anti-bacterial gel and cleaning products if needed
-   there is no need for anything other than normal personal hygiene and
    washing of clothes following a day in an educational or childcare
    setting

Reduce mixing within education or childcare setting by:

-   accessing rooms directly from outside where possible
-   considering one-way circulation, or place a divider down the middle
    of the corridor to keep groups apart as they move through the
    setting where spaces are accessed by corridors
-   staggering breaks to ensure that any corridors or circulation routes
    used have a limited number of pupils using them at any time
-   staggering lunch breaks - children and young people should clean
    their hands beforehand and enter in the groups they are already in,
    groups should be kept apart as much as possible and tables should be
    cleaned between each group. If such measures are not possible,
    children should be brought their lunch in their classrooms
-   ensuring that toilets do not become crowded by limiting the number
    of children or young people who use the toilet facilities at one
    time
-   noting that some children and young people will need additional
    support to follow these measures (for example, routes round school
    marked in braille or with other meaningful symbols, and social
    stories to support them in understanding how to follow rules)

Use outside space:

-   for exercise and breaks
-   for outdoor education, where possible, as this can limit
    transmission and more easily allow for distance between children and
    staff
-   although outdoor equipment should not be used unless the setting is
    able to ensure that it is appropriately cleaned between groups of
    children and young people using it, and that multiple groups do not
    use it simultaneously. Read [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}

For shared rooms:

-   use halls, dining areas and internal and external sports facilities
    for lunch and exercise at half capacity. If class groups take
    staggered breaks between lessons, these areas can be shared as long
    as different groups do not mix (and especially do not play sports or
    games together) and adequate cleaning between groups between groups
    is in place, following the [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare
    settings
    guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}
-   stagger the use of staff rooms and offices to limit occupancy

Reduce the use of shared resources:

-   by limiting the amount of shared resources that are taken home and
    limit exchange of take-home resources between children, young people
    and staff
-   by seeking to prevent the sharing of stationery and other equipment
    where possible. Shared materials and surfaces should be cleaned and
    disinfected more frequently
-   although practical lessons can go ahead if equipment can be cleaned
    thoroughly and the classroom or other learning environment is
    occupied by the same children or young people in one day, or
    properly cleaned between cohorts

Adjust transport arrangements where necessary including:

-   encouraging parents and children and young people to walk or cycle
    to their education setting where possible
-   making sure schools, parents and young people follow the
    [Coronavirus (COVID-19): safer travel guidance for
    passengers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers){.govuk-link}
    when planning their travel
-   ensuring that transport arrangements cater for any changes to start
    and finish times
-   making sure transport providers do not work if they or a member of
    their household are displaying any symptoms of coronavirus
-   making sure transport providers, as far as possible, follow hygiene
    rules and try to keep distance from their passengers
-   taking appropriate actions to reduce risk if hygiene rules and
    social distancing is not possible, for example when transporting
    children and young people with complex needs who need support to
    access the vehicle or fasten seatbelts
-   local authorities or transport providers could consider the
    following:
    -   guidance or training for school transport colleagues
    -   substituting smaller vehicles with larger ones, or running 2
        vehicles rather than one, where possible, to reduce the number
        of passengers per vehicle and increase the amount of space
        between passengers
    -   cordoning off seats and eliminating face-to-face seating, where
        vehicle capacity allows, to help passengers spread out
-   communicating revised travel plans clearly to contractors, local
    authorities and parents where appropriate (for instance, to agree
    pick-up and drop-off times)

Additional questions
--------------------

### Will contact tracing be in place in educational and childcare settings?

The government is developing a new national test and trace programme.
This will bring together an app, expanded web and phone-based contact
tracing, and swab testing for those with potential coronavirus symptoms.
This programme will play an important role in helping to minimise the
spread of coronavirus in the future. It will also include more
traditional methods of contact tracing if a child, young person or
parent tests positive. This could include, for example, direct
discussion with parents and schools or colleges on recent contacts. The
government is recruiting 18,000 contact tracers to support contact
tracing and will recruit more if needed. They will play an important
part in tracing the contacts of those with coronavirus, including
children.

### What happens if someone becomes unwell at an educational or childcare setting?

If anyone in an education or childcare setting becomes unwell with a
new, continuous cough or a high temperature, or has a loss of, or change
in, their normal sense of taste of smell (anosmia), they must be sent
home and advised to follow the [COVID-19: guidance for households with
possible coronavirus infection
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

If a child is awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to
a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, depending on the
age of the child and with appropriate adult supervision if required.
Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not
possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2
metres away from other people.

If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they
should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be
cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being
used by anyone else.

PPE should be worn by staff caring for the child while they await
collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained (such as for a
very young child or a child with complex needs).

In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their
life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a
hospital.

If a member of staff has helped someone with symptoms, they do not need
to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves (and in which case, a
test is available) or the child subsequently tests positive (see ‘What
happens if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus in a setting?’
below). They should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any
contact with someone who is unwell. Cleaning the affected area with
normal household disinfectant after someone with symptoms has left will
reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people. See the
[COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### What happens if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus in a setting?

When a child, young person or staff member develops symptoms compatible
with coronavirus, they should be sent home and advised to self-isolate
for 7 days. Their fellow household members should self-isolate for 14
days. All staff and students who are attending an education or childcare
setting will have access to a test if they display symptoms of
coronavirus, and are encouraged to get tested in this scenario.

Where the child, young person or staff member tests negative, they can
return to their setting and the fellow household members can end their
self-isolation.

Where the child, young person or staff member tests positive, the rest
of their class or group within their childcare or education setting
should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The other
household members of that wider class or group do not need to
self-isolate unless the child, young person or staff member they live
with in that group subsequently develops symptoms.

As part of the national test and trace programme, if other cases are
detected within the cohort or in the wider setting, Public Health
England’s local health protection teams will conduct a rapid
investigation and will advise schools and other settings on the most
appropriate action to take. In some cases a larger number of other
children, young people may be asked to self-isolate at home as a
precautionary measure – perhaps the whole class, site or year group.
Where settings are observing guidance on infection prevention and
control, which will reduce risk of transmission, closure of the whole
setting will not generally be necessary.

### Should educational settings ask parents to report pupils’ temperatures at the start of each day?

Parents, carers and settings do not need to take children’s temperatures
every morning. Routine testing of an individual’s temperature is not a
reliable method for identifying coronavirus. Educational and childcare
settings should reiterate to parents the need to follow the standard
national advice on the kind of symptoms to look out for that might be
due to coronavirus, and where to get further advice.If anyone in the
household develops a fever, or a new continuous cough, or a loss of, or
change in, their normal sense of taste or smell (anosmia), they are
advised to follow the [COVID-19: guidance for households with possible
coronavirus infection
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
(which states that the ill person should remain in isolation for 7 days
and the rest of the household in isolation for 14 days).

### Will children and young people be eligible for testing?

When settings open to the wider cohort of children and young people, all
those children and young people eligible to attend, and members of their
households, will have access to testing if they display symptoms of
coronavirus. This will enable them to get back into childcare or
education, and their parents or carers to get back to work, if the test
proves to be negative. To access testing parents will be able to use the
111 online coronavirus service if their child is 5 or over. Parents will
be able to call 111 if their child is aged under 5.

### Will teachers and other staff be able to get tested if they have symptoms?

Access to testing is already available to all essential workers. This
includes anyone involved in education, childcare or social work –
including both public and voluntary sector workers, as well as foster
carers. See the [full list of essential
workers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#essential-workers){.govuk-link}.
Education settings as employers can book tests through an online digital
portal. There is also an option for employees to book tests directly on
the portal.

### How should special schools and colleges consider and manage risks in supporting children and young people with complex needs?

We have published [guidance for special schools, specialist colleges,
local authorities and any other
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-send-risk-assessment-guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-send-risk-assessment-guidance){.govuk-link}
managing children and young people with education, health and care
plans, including those with complex needs. This covers recommendations
for educational settings, working with local areas and families, on how
to assess risks in supporting children and young people.

### What does implementing protective measures look like in alternative provision (AP)?

AP settings should follow the same principles and guidance as mainstream
schools. As much as possible, protective measures should be adhered to
and class or group sizes should be small. Staff should use simple
language to explain safety measures, and reiterate and reinforce key
messages. Safe routines for access to toilets, hand-cleaning and break
and lunch times should be put in place. Teaching resources can be used
to aid understanding.

Settings may need to carry out a risk assessment, if it is deemed that a
child or young person may not be able to follow instructions, to
determine what mitigations need to be put in place and whether, in rare
circumstances, they should stay at home. For those children and young
people with a social worker, our expectation is that they should attend
their educational setting unless a risk assessment concludes they will
be safer at home.
