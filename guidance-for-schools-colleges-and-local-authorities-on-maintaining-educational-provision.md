Early years and childcare settings, schools and colleges continue to be
open for all children and young people in England and attendance of
school age children remains compulsory.

These settings may however need to change how they are delivering
education and childcare for a short period of time in line with the
[Contingency
Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-local-restrictions-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
In all circumstances, and in all settings, priority should continue to
be given to vulnerable children and young people and children of
critical workers (as defined below) to attend full time.

Vulnerable children and young people
------------------------------------

Vulnerable children and young people include those who:

-   are assessed as being in need under section 17 of the Children Act
    1989, including children and young people who have a child in need
    plan, a child protection plan or who are a looked-after child
-   have an education, health and care (EHC) plan
-   have been identified as otherwise vulnerable by educational
    providers or local authorities (including children’s social care
    services), and who could therefore benefit from continued full-time
    attendance. This might include:
    -   children and young people on the edge of receiving support from
        children’s social care services or in the process of being
        referred to children’s services or who have previously received
        support from children’s social care services (as identified by
        local authorities)
    -   adopted children or children on a special guardianship order
    -   those at risk of becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or
        training’)
    -   those living in temporary accommodation
    -   those who are young carers
    -   those who may have difficulty engaging with remote education at
        home (for example due to a lack of devices or quiet space to
        study)
    -   care leavers
    -   children and young people in a family circumstance presenting
        challenges for them, such as drug and alcohol misuse, parental
        offending, adult mental health issues and domestic abuse
    -   others at the provider and local authority’s discretion
        including pupils and students who need to attend to receive
        support or manage risks to their mental health

include those who work in health and social care and in other key
