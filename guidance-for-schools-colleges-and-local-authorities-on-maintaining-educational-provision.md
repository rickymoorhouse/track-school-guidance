This guidance is applicable to 31 May 2020 and will be reviewed before 1
June 2020.

</div>

Since 23 March, in line with the scientific advice, nurseries, schools
and colleges have remained open only to a priority group of children and
young people, children who have a parent who is a critical worker and
vulnerable children.

Now that we have made progress in reducing the transmission of
coronavirus **we are encouraging all eligible children to attend
settings (where there are no shielding concerns for the child or their
household)**, even if parents are able to keep their children at
home.****

From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will also be asking
primary schools to welcome back children in nursery, reception, year 1
and year 6, alongside priority groups. We will ask secondary schools,
sixth-form colleges and further education colleges to offer some
face-to-face support for year 10 and year 12 students who are due to
take key exams next year, alongside priority groups. We are also asking
nurseries and other early years providers, including childminders, to
begin welcoming back all children from 1 June. Alternative provision
settings should mirror the approach being taken for mainstream schools
and also offer some face-to-face support for years 10 and 11 students
(as they have no year 12). We are asking special schools, special
post-16 institutions and hospital schools to follow an equivalent phased
return without a focus on specific year groups.

**Children of critical workers, and vulnerable children who are already
eligible, will continue to be offered a place, regardless of the year
group they are in.**

**The definition of critical workers remains unchanged.**

Our ambition is to bring all primary year groups back to school before
the summer holidays, for a month if feasible, though this will be kept
under review. Schools will only welcome back additional year groups if
the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus indicates
it is appropriate to have larger numbers of children within schools. The
safety of children and staff is our utmost priority.

Any setting that cannot achieve these increases at any point because:

-   there are not enough classrooms or spaces available in the setting
-   they do not have enough available teachers or staff to supervise the
    groups

have flexibility but must first focus on continuing to provide places
for priority groups (vulnerable children and the children of critical
workers).

Vulnerable children and young people
------------------------------------

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, for the purposes of
continued attendance at educational settings, vulnerable children and
young people are defined as those who:

-   are assessed as being in need under section 17 of the Children Act
    1989, including children who have a child in need plan, a child
    protection plan or who are a looked-after child
-   have an education, health and care (EHC) plan and it is determined,
    following risk assessment, that their needs can be as safely or more
    safely met in the educational environment
-   have been assessed as otherwise vulnerable by educational providers
    or local authorities (including children’s social care services),
    and who are therefore in need of continued education provision -
    this might include children on the edge of receiving support from
    children’s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of
    becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’), those
    who are young carers and others at the provider and local
    authority’s discretion

Critical workers
----------------

Parents whose work is critical to the COVID-19 response include those
who work in health and social care and in other key sectors outlined
below. Many parents working in these sectors may be able to look after
their child at home, but attendance is strongly encouraged.

Please, therefore, also follow these key principles:

1.  If a child needs specialist support, is vulnerable or has a parent
    who is a critical worker, then educational provision will be
    available for them.

2.  Parents should not rely for childcare upon those who are advised to
    be in the stringent social distancing category such as grandparents,
    friends, or family members with underlying conditions.

3.  Parents must do everything they can to ensure children are not
    mixing socially outside of school. They must observe the same social
    distancing principles as adults, as far as possible.

4.  Residential special schools, boarding schools and special settings
    continue to care for children wherever possible.

If your work is critical to the COVID-19 response, or you work in one of
the critical sectors listed below, then your children will be
prioritised for education provision and are strongly encouraged to
attend.

### Health and social care

paramedics, social workers, care workers, and other frontline health and
social care staff including volunteers; the support and specialist staff
required to maintain the UK’s health and social care sector; those
working as part of the health and social care supply chain, including
producers and distributors of medicines and medical and personal
protective equipment.

### Education and childcare

This includes:

This includes those involved in food:

-   production
-   processing

    example hygienic and veterinary medicines)

### Public safety and national security

This includes:

-   Ministry of Defence civilians
-   contractor and armed forces personnel (those critical to the
    delivery of key defence and national security outputs and essential
    to the response to the COVID-19 outbreak)
-   fire and rescue service employees (including support staff)
-   National Crime Agency staff
-   those maintaining border security, prison and probation staff and
    other national security roles, including those overseas

### Transport

This includes those who will keep the air, water, road and rail
passenger and freight transport modes operating during the COVID-19
response, including those working on transport systems through which
supply chains pass.

### Utilities, communication and financial services

This includes:

-   staff needed for essential financial services provision (including
    but not limited to workers in banks, building societies and
    financial market infrastructure)
-   the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors (including sewerage)
-   information technology and data infrastructure sector and primary
    industry supplies to continue during the COVID-19 response
-   key staff working in the civil nuclear, chemicals,
    telecommunications (including but not limited to network operations,
    field engineering, call centre staff, IT and data infrastructure,
    999 and 111 critical services)
-   postal services and delivery
-   payments providers
-   waste disposal sectors

If your school is closed, then please [contact your local
authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council){.govuk-link}, who will
seek to redirect you to a local school in your area that your child, or
children, can attend.

We are grateful for the work of teachers and workers in educational
settings for continuing to provide for the children of the other
critical workers of our country. It is an essential part of our national
effort to combat this disease.
