We will update this guidance before 1 June 2020 to reflect the
[announcements made on 24 May
2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-confirms-schools-colleges-and-nurseries-on-track-to-begin-phased-reopening){.govuk-link}.

</div>

As part of national social distancing measures to limit the spread of
coronavirus (COVID-19), we have had to limit the numbers of children and
young people attending educational and childcare settings, to ensure
that pupils and staff attending could do so safely. That is why, since
23 March 2020, education and childcare settings have only been open to
priority groups ([vulnerable
children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people){.govuk-link}
and [children of critical
workers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision){.govuk-link})^[1](#fn:1){.govuk-link}^.

As well as offering face-to-face provision for those able to attend,
settings have also done a huge amount to support the remote education of
those who have been staying at home. Innovative and fast-paced work has
taken place, by committed staff, to develop resources to make this
education the best it can be.

Throughout this period, the work and dedication of critical workers has
been crucial to our country. This of course includes all our critical
workers working with children and young people – leaders, teachers,
support staff, childcare workers, social workers and others, who have
worked tirelessly to support the education and welfare of young people.

As a result of the huge efforts everyone has made to adhere to strict
social distancing measures, the transmission rate of coronavirus has
decreased. We therefore anticipate, with further progress, that we may
be able, from the week commencing 1 June 2020 to welcome back more
children to early years, school and further education settings. We will
only do this provided that the five key tests set by government justify
the changes at the time, including that the rate of infection is
decreasing and the enabling programmes set out in [the UK Government’s
COVID-19 recovery
strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/our-plan-to-rebuild-the-uk-governments-covid-19-recovery-strategy){.govuk-link}
are operating effectively. As a result we are asking schools, colleges
and childcare providers to plan on this basis, ahead of confirmation
that these tests are met.

We have worked closely with the sector, and will continue to do so over
the coming weeks to support the wider opening of schools, colleges and
childcare settings. In this document we are setting out the overarching
aims and principles of this next phase, including information about
protective measures which will be in place. We will work with the
profession to produce more detailed guidance ahead of 1 June 2020.

Next steps
----------

Education and childcare settings are already open to priority groups.
Now that we have made progress in reducing the transmission of
coronavirus we are encouraging all eligible children to attend – it is
no longer necessary for parents of eligible children to keep them at
home if they can. In particular, as per the [existing guidance on
vulnerable children and young
people](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people){.govuk-link},
vulnerable children of all year groups continue to be expected and
encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for
them to do so.

From the week commencing 1 June 2020 at the earliest, we will be asking
primary schools to welcome back children in Nursery, Reception, year 1
and year 6, alongside priority groups. We will ask secondary schools,
sixth form and further education colleges to offer some face-to-face
support to supplement the remote education of year 10 and year 12
students who are due to take key exams next year, alongside the full
time provision they are offering to priority groups.

We are also asking nurseries and other early years providers, including
childminders, to begin welcoming back all children. Alternative
provision settings should mirror the approach being taken for mainstream
schools and also offer some face-to-face support for year 10 and 11
students (as they have no year 12). Special schools, special post-16
institutions and hospital schools will work towards a phased return of
more children and young people without a focus on specific year groups.

We want to get all children and young people back into education as soon
as the scientific advice allows because it is the best place for them to
learn, and because we know how important it is for their mental
wellbeing to have social interactions with their peers, carers and
teachers. Children returning to educational and childcare settings in
greater numbers will also allow more families to return to work.

We are therefore gradually increasing the numbers of children and young
people attending schools and colleges. This decision is based on the
latest scientific advice. By returning pupils gradually, settings can
initially reduce the number of children and young people in classrooms
compared to usual and put protective measures in place to reduce risks.
Children will need to stay within their new class/group wherever
possible and we will ask settings to [implement a range of protective
measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}
including increased cleaning, reducing ‘pinch points’ (such as parents
dropping children off at the start and end of the day), and utilising
outdoor space. Staff and pupils in all settings will be eligible for
testing if they become ill with coronavirus symptoms, as will members of
their households. A negative test will enable children to get back to
childcare or education, and their parents to get back to work. A
positive test will ensure rapid action to protect their classmates and
staff in their setting. Those who are clinically vulnerable, or are
living with someone who is, should follow our [protective measures
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

In childcare settings, providers will be asked to welcome back all
children below statutory school age from the week commencing 1 June
2020. Demand for childcare is likely to be lower than usual at first,
and existing space requirements and staff to child ratios for these age
groups should allow for small group working. Where the physical layout
of a setting does not allow small groups of children to be kept at a
safe distance apart, we expect practitioners to exercise judgement in
ensuring the highest standards of safety are maintained. In some cases,
it may be necessary for providers to introduce a temporary cap on
numbers to ensure that safety is prioritised. From 1 June 2020,
childminders can look after children of all ages, in line with usual
limits on the number of children they can care for.

Our ambition is to bring all primary year groups back to school before
the summer holidays, for a month if feasible, though this will be kept
under review. We will only welcome back additional year groups if the
most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus indicates it
is appropriate to have larger numbers of children within schools. The
safety of children and staff is our utmost priority.

Year groups in first phase of wider opening
-------------------------------------------

The three year groups within mainstream primary have been prioritised
because they are key transition years – children in Reception and year 1
are at the very beginning of their school career and are mastering the
essential basics, including counting and the fundamentals of reading and
writing, and learning to socialise with their peers. We know that
attending early education lays the foundation for lifelong learning and
supports children’s social and emotional development. Year 6 children
are finishing Key Stage 2 and are preparing for the transition to
secondary school, and will benefit immensely from time with their
friends and teachers to ensure they are ready.

We will prioritise younger children in the first phases of wider
opening, for several reasons. Firstly, because there is moderately high
scientific confidence in evidence suggesting younger children are less
likely to become unwell if infected with coronavirus; and secondly
because evidence shows the particularly detrimental impact which time
spent out of education can have upon them. In addition, older children
are more likely to have higher numbers of contacts outside of school so
pose a greater transmission risk, and they are typically better able to
learn at home.

The two year groups in mainstream secondary schools and colleges have
been prioritised because they are preparing for key examinations next
year, and are most at risk of falling behind due to time out of school
or college. From 1 June 2020, we expect that secondary schools and
colleges will be able to offer some face to face contact with year 10
and year 12 pupils. This will not be a return to full timetables or
pupils back in school or college full time, rather some support to
supplement pupils’ remote education. In line with implementing
protective measures and reducing contacts, schools and colleges should
limit the attendance of the year 10 and 12 cohort in the setting at any
one time and to keep students in small groups as [set out in our
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
Schools and colleges should also ensure that the use of public transport
for travel to and from school/college is minimised, especially at peak
times. We will be consulting with sector representatives over the coming
week in order to develop some suggested models to demonstrate how this
could operate, which will be published along with further guidance for
secondary schools in the coming weeks.

Our approach is in line with other countries across Europe, who have
begun to bring pre-school and school-age children back in a phased way
and are focusing on primary schools and younger children. Approaches
between countries will vary slightly based on different public health
circumstances.

We expect all mainstream schools and colleges, including independent
schools, to follow the same approach. We encourage middle schools to do
the same and welcome back children in year 6, to ensure national parity
for children in this year group.

Any educational or childcare settings which have closed should work
towards reopening from the week commencing 1 June 2020 to cater for
children in nurseries, Reception, year 1, year 6 and priority groups,
and to provide some face to face support to pupils in years 10 and 12.

We will provide all educational and childcare settings with further
guidance and support to help them to prepare for wider opening over the
coming weeks and continue to work closely with the sector.

What the latest science tells us
--------------------------------

The above approach is underpinned by our latest understanding of the
science, which indicates that we need to take a phased approach to limit
the risk of increasing the rate of transmission (often referred to as R)
above 1. We have factored in:

-   severity of disease in children – there is high scientific
    confidence that children of all ages have less severe symptoms than
    adults if they contract coronavirus
-   the age of children – there is moderately high scientific confidence
    that younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected
    with coronavirus
-   numbers of children going back – which needs to be limited initially
    then increased gradually as the science permits
-   systems to reduce the size of the groups coming into contact with
    each other – such as smaller class sizes spread out across settings

Approach: First phase of wider opening of educational and childcare settings (from 1 June 2020 depending on the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the week commencing 1 June 2020 at the earliest, we are asking
nurseries and other early years settings to open to all children;
primary schools to welcome back pupils to Nursery, Reception, year 1 and
year 6 (including in middle schools); secondary schools and colleges to
offer some face to face support for children and young people in year 10
and year 12 to supplement their remote education; alternative provision
to mirror the approach being taken for mainstream schools and also offer
some face-to-face support for year 10 and year 11 students (as they have
no year 12); and special schools, special post-16 institutions and
hospital schools to welcome back more pupils and students.

We will assess the impact of these changes closely, working with medical
and scientific advisers as well as sector leaders. When the most
up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus indicates that it
is appropriate to do so, we will ask more primary year groups to return
to school, and issue revised guidance.

The following principles will apply to this phase of wider opening by
settings:

-   children and young people in eligible year groups are strongly
    encouraged to attend (where there are no shielding concerns for the
    child or their household), so that they can gain the educational and
    wellbeing benefits of attending
-   vulnerable children of all year groups continue to be expected and
    encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate
    for them to do so (for children with education health and care (EHC)
    plans this will be informed by a risk assessment approach)
-   children, young people and staff who have been classed as
    [clinically extremely vulnerable due to pre-existing medical
    conditions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/covid-19-guidance-on-protecting-people-most-likely-to-get-unwell-from-coronavirus-shielding-young-peoples-version){.govuk-link}
    have been advised to shield. We do not expect people in this
    category to be attending school or college, and they should continue
    to be supported to learn or work at home as much as possible.
    Clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable)
    people are those considered to be at a higher risk of severe illness
    from coronavirus. Few if any children will fall into this category,
    but parents should follow medical advice if their child is in this
    category. Staff in this category should work from home where
    possible, and refer to the detail in our protective measures
    guidance
-   a child/young person or a member of staff who lives with someone who
    is clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable),
    including those who are pregnant, can attend their education or
    childcare setting
-   if a child/young person or staff member lives in a household with
    someone who is extremely clinically vulnerable, as set out in the
    [guidance on
    shielding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link},
    it is advised they only attend an education or childcare setting if
    stringent social distancing can be adhered to and, in the case of
    children, if they are able to understand and follow those
    instructions. This may not be possible for very young children and
    older children without the capacity to adhere to the instructions on
    social distancing. If stringent social distancing cannot be adhered
    to, we do not expect those individuals to attend. They should be
    supported to learn or work at home
-   staff and children or young people should not attend if they have
    symptoms or are self-isolating due to symptoms in their household
-   protective measures will be put in place for staff and pupils, as
    far as is possible, to ensure that the risk of transmission is
    reduced

Implementation: Managing risk and rate of transmission
------------------------------------------------------

Scientific advice indicates that a phased return that limits the number
of children in education settings and how much they mix with each other
will help to control the rate of transmission. This is set out in [our
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

There are a number of immediate issues which educational and childcare
settings will need to consider. The following list of issues are the
ones we have identified as the top priorities. We recognise that each
setting and community is different, and that leaders will need to make
their own judgements on the most important issues for them. Further
guidance on these, and other important areas, will be developed with the
sector in the coming days and weeks.

Key issues
----------

### Risk assessment

Every setting should carry out a risk assessment before opening. The
assessment should directly address risks associated with coronavirus, so
that sensible measures can be put in place to control those risks for
children and staff. All employers have a duty to consult employees on
health and safety, and they are best placed to understand the risks in
individual settings.

### Class sizes and staff availability

One of the protective measures we can take to reduce transmission is to
have smaller group and class sizes. We know that, unlike older children
and adults, early years and primary age children cannot be expected to
remain 2 metres apart from each other and staff. In deciding to bring
more children back to early years and schools, we are taking this into
account. Schools should therefore work through the hierarchy of measures
set out in our
[guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}:

-   avoiding contact with anyone with symptoms
-   frequent hand cleaning and good hygiene practices
-   regular cleaning of settings
-   and minimising contact and mixing

It is still important to reduce contact between children and staff as
far as possible, and settings can take steps to achieve that and reduce
transmission risk by ensuring children, and staff where possible, mix in
a small group and keep that small group away from other people and
groups. For pre-school children in early years settings, the staff to
child ratios within Early Years Foundation Stage continue to apply, and
we recommend using these to group children. In mainstream schools and
college settings the basic principle is that classes should be halved.
Normally one teacher should be allocated to a group but if there are any
teacher shortages then support staff may be used to lead groups, under
the direction of a teacher. More detail is provided in our [protective
measures
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Public Health England are clear that if early years, school and college
settings do this, and crucially if they also apply comprehensive
infection control measures, such as taking steps to ensure symptomatic
individuals do not attend settings, regular hand cleaning, respiratory
hygiene and cleaning measures and handling potential cases of the virus
as per our advice, then the risk of transmission will be lowered.

Where settings can keep children and young people in those small groups
2m away from each other, they should do so. While in general groups
should be kept apart, brief, transitory, contact such as passing in a
corridor is low risk.

Each setting’s circumstances will be slightly different. Any setting
that cannot achieve these small groups at any point should discuss
options with their local authority or trust. This might be because there
are not enough classrooms / spaces available in the setting or because
they do not have enough available teachers / staff to supervise the
groups. Solutions might involve children attending a nearby school (on a
consistent basis). If necessary, settings have the flexibility to focus
first on continuing to provide places for priority groups and then, to
support children’s early learning, settings should prioritise groups of
children as follows:

-   early years settings – 3 and 4 year olds followed by younger age
    groups
-   infant schools - nursery (where applicable) and reception
-   primary schools – nursery (where applicable), reception and year 1

Our ambition is to bring all primary year groups back to school before
the summer holidays, for a month if feasible, though this will be kept
under review. We will review this advice on class sizes as and when the
science indicates it is safe to invite more children back to childcare
settings, schools and colleges.

### Protective measures in education and childcare settings

The DfE guidance on [Implementing Protective Measures in Education and
Childcare
Settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}
contains detailed advice for settings on:

-   cleaning, including supplies of cleaning and handwashing products
-   testing and tracing
-   personal protective equipment (PPE)
-   what settings should do in response to a case of COVID-19 being
    confirmed

### Attendance

No one with symptoms should attend a setting for any reason. Eligible
children – including priority groups - are strongly encouraged to attend
their education setting, unless they are self-isolating or they are
clinically vulnerable (in which case they should follow medical advice).
If someone in their household is extremely clinically vulnerable, they
should only attend if stringent social distancing can be adhered to, and
the child is able to understand and follow those instructions. Families
should notify their nursery/school/college as normal if their child is
unable to attend so that staff can explore the reason with them and
address barriers together. Parents will not be fined for non-attendance
at this time, and schools and colleges will not be held to account for
attendance levels. Schools and colleges should continue to inform social
workers where children with a social worker do not attend.

Schools and colleges should resume taking their attendance register and
continue to complete the online Educational Setting Status form which
gives the Department for Education daily updates on how many children
and staff are attending. The Department will continue to monitor
attendance at early years settings, via local authorities. This is to
ensure that we have up-to-date information on available early years and
childcare provision during the coronavirus outbreak, which children are
accessing it and to monitor sufficiency in particular areas.

### Vulnerable children and young people

There is a continuing expectation that vulnerable children and young
people of all year groups will attend educational or childcare
provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so. As per the
current guidance, where these children and young people are currently
not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and
local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance.

Vulnerable children and young people in this context include those who:

-   are assessed as being in need under section 17 of the Children Act
    1989, including children who have a child in need plan, a child
    protection plan or who are a looked-after child. Attendance is
    expected, unless their social worker decides that they are at less
    risk at home or in their placement. The educational provider should
    notify the social worker in cases where these children or young
    people do not take up their place at school or college

-   have an education, health and care (EHC) plan and it is determined,
    following a risk assessment, carried out with educational providers
    and parents, that their needs can be as safely or more safely met in
    the educational environment

-   have been assessed as otherwise vulnerable by educational providers
    or local authorities (including children’s social care services),
    and who are therefore in need of continued education provision -
    this might include children on the edge of receiving support from
    children’s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of
    becoming NEET (‘not in employment, education or training’), those
    who are young carers and others at the provider and local
    authority’s discretion

### Alternative Provision

Alternative Provision (AP) settings should follow the same principles
and guidance as mainstream schools and welcome back, from 1 June 2020,
all children in Reception, year 1 and year 6. AP settings do not have a
year 12, so they should also offer some face to face support for
students in year 10 and year 11 to supplement their remote education, as
they are approaching key transition points. In line with the advice
above for mainstream provision, settings should limit the numbers in
attendance at any one time and aim to keep students in small groups as
[set out in our
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
Settings should also consider ways to minimise use of public transport
to get to and from school at peak times, in consultation with local
authorities. Priority groups of all ages should continue to be offered a
place and strongly encouraged to attend.

### Special schools

Special schools, special post-16 institutions and hospital schools
should work towards welcoming back as many children and young people as
can be safely catered for in their setting. They may want to prioritise
attendance based on key transitions and the impact on life chances and
development, and to consider creating part-time attendance rotas so that
as many children as possible can benefit from attending their setting.
Special settings should work with local authorities and families to
ensure that decisions about attendance are informed by existing risk
assessments for their children and young people, which should be kept up
to date.

### Sixth form and further education (FE) colleges

Sixth form colleges should offer some face to face support to students
in year 12 to supplement their remote education, alongside their offer
to priority groups.

Further education (FE) colleges should also offer some face to face
support to students who are in the equivalent of year 10 and year 12,
who are studying for key examinations next academic year, along with
those in priority groups. We will work with the sector to provide
additional guidance for FE colleges on provision for these and other
disproportionately affected learners.

### Curriculum

The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) sets the standards that schools
and childcare settings must meet for the learning, development and care
of children from birth to 5 years old. Early years settings should use
reasonable endeavours to deliver the learning and development
requirements as far as possible in the current circumstances, as [set
out
here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2/early-years-foundation-stage-coronavirus-disapplications){.govuk-link}.

Schools and colleges continue to be best placed to make decisions about
how to support and educate all their pupils during this period, based on
the local context and staff capacity.

Where year groups are returning to school, we would expect school
leaders and teachers to:

-   consider their pupils’ mental health and wellbeing and identify any
    pupil who may need additional support so they are ready to learn
-   assess where pupils are in their learning, and agree what
    adjustments may be needed to the school curriculum over the coming
    weeks
-   identify and plan how best to support the education of high needs
    groups, including disadvantaged pupils, and SEND and vulnerable
    pupils
-   support pupils in Year 6, who will need both their primary and
    secondary schools to work together to support their upcoming
    transition to Year 7

Schools should use best endeavours to support pupils attending school as
well as those remaining at home, making use of the available [remote
education
support](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19){.govuk-link}.

No school will be penalised if they are unable to offer a broad and
balanced curriculum to their pupils during this period.

### Priority groups

Settings will need to consider how they integrate children and young
people from priority groups who are attending but not in any of the
transition year groups into their education offer. Settings have the
flexibility to make the right decision for their circumstances on how
these pupils are supervised, continue to learn and are supported in
school.

### Assessment and accountability

There are no changes to the previously announced expectations on
assessment and accountability. No examinations or assessments will take
place this term and Ofsted will continue to pause routine inspection.

### Staff workload and wellbeing

Governing boards and senior leaders should be conscious of the wellbeing
of all staff, including senior leaders themselves, and the need to
implement flexible working practices in a way that promotes good
work-life balance and supports teachers and leaders.

Workload should be carefully managed and schools and colleges should
assess whether staff who are having to stay at home due to health
conditions are able to support remote education, while others focus on
face-to-face provision. Senior leaders and boards will want to factor
this into their resource and curriculum planning, and consider where
additional resource could be safely brought in if necessary.

### Transport

Parents and children and young people should be encouraged to walk or
cycle where possible, and avoid public transport at peak times.

They should refer to [guidance on safe travel, particularly on public
transport](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-travel-guidance-for-passengers){.govuk-link}.

Home to school transport provided or organised by schools, trusts or
local authorities varies widely. Schools, trusts and local authorities
should work together and with relevant transport providers to put in
place arrangements which fit the local circumstances, including the
measures being put in place to reduce contact.

Further guidance is available in [Guidance on implementing protective
measures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### Food

Schools should provide meals for all children in school, and meals
should be available free of charge where pupils meet the free school
meal (FSM) eligibility criteria. To ensure food is available for pupils
who attend, educational settings are expected to reopen their kitchens
and ensure that meals are able to be prepared and served safely.

We are also continuing to ask schools to work with their food providers
to offer meals or food parcels for benefits-related free school meal
pupils not in school. Now that schools are opening more widely, school
catering teams will be better placed to do this. The provision of food
vouchers for those eligible under the benefits criteria will also
continue to be available where needed. Information on supporting those
in FE with free meals is in the [FE operational
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision){.govuk-link}.

### Costs associated with opening for more children and young people

As previously confirmed, schools will continue to receive their core
funding allocations – as determined by the local authority for
maintained schools and through the general annual grant (GAG) for
academies. FE colleges continue to receive funding in line with the
flexibilities that have been announced in recent weeks including payment
on profile for 16-19 study programmes without reconciliation. In
addition, we have announced a fund for schools to cover specific
additional costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak – this remains
open and should be used by schools as appropriate. Access to the wider
business support schemes, including Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme
(CJRS), can continue to be used for staff typically paid for through
private income, on condition that the principles in Department for
Education’s [sector specific
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-financial-support-for-education-early-years-and-childrens-social-care/coronavirus-covid-19-financial-support-for-education-early-years-and-childrens-social-care){.govuk-link}
continue to be met.

For early years settings, the dedicated schools grant (DSG) should
continue to be paid by local authorities for provision of free
entitlements. Where parents are accessing hours beyond the free
entitlements they are eligible for, early year providers should continue
to charge parents in the normal way. The wider business support packages
can continue to be used as appropriate, including the loan schemes and
the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), on condition that the
principles in Department for Education’s [sector specific
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-financial-support-for-education-early-years-and-childrens-social-care/coronavirus-covid-19-financial-support-for-education-early-years-and-childrens-social-care){.govuk-link}
continue to be met.

We are continuing to work with the childcare sector to understand how
the early years sector can best be supported to ensure that sufficient
safe, appropriate and affordable childcare is available for those
returning to work now, and for all families who need it in the longer
term.

### Further guidance and support

We have published:

-   [supporting guidance on protective measures which should be
    implemented in education
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings){.govuk-link}
-   [guidance for parents and
    carers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closure-of-educational-settings-information-for-parents-and-carers){.govuk-link}

This complements the [existing guidance for schools and educational
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-schools-and-other-educational-settings){.govuk-link}
that continues to be relevant (and which will be updated in due course
where needed).

We will publish further guidance for senior leaders to enable them to
work through the actions they need to take to get ready for 1 June 2020.
This will be co-produced with experienced school and trust leaders and
sector representatives.
