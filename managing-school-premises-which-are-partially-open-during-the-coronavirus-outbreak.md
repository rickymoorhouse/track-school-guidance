Schools continue to be responsible for a range of health and safety
measures and statutory compliance.

See the [health and
safety](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools/health-and-safety){.govuk-link}
section of good estate management for schools.

</div>

Managing partially open buildings
---------------------------------

It is important that arrangements remain in place to ensure that
children and staff are in safe buildings during reduced occupancy
arrangements.

Schools should review their arrangements for all building-related
systems but in particular:

-   hot and cold water systems
-   gas safety
-   fire safety
-   kitchen equipment
-   security including access control and intruder alarm systems
-   ventilation

Staff should be familiar with the [actions for schools during the
coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-school-closures/guidance-for-schools-about-temporarily-closing){.govuk-link}
and work with their responsible bodies to ensure that statutory health
and safety arrangements are in place.

<div class="application-notice help-notice" role="note"
aria-label="Warning">

There are increased risks related to safety concerns around water
hygiene, building and occupancy safety, as well as, building hygiene.

</div>

Contact your contractors and suppliers to check on any special interim
arrangements in place due to the coronavirus outbreak.

In all schools, a member of staff should be identified with
responsibility for managing premises. In cases of staff illness, cover
arrangements should be put in place as soon as possible.

Cold water systems
------------------

This includes:

-   tanks
-   sinks
-   basins
-   showers
-   drinking water outlets (taps and water fountains)

Do not drain down systems.

Increase the frequency of outlet flushing and temperature monitoring to
maintain water quality within the entire system.

If required, consider additional water quality testing at water outlets
(closest and further from the main water source) and drinking water
outlets that remain in use.

Domestic hot water services
---------------------------

This includes:

-   calorifiers
-   direct-fired water heaters
-   sinks
-   basins
-   showers

Do not drain down systems, you should continue hot water generation
servicing in line with manufacturers’ criteria.

Water temperatures must be kept within limits recommended for the
control of legionella bacteria in water systems. For reference, use the
[Approved Code of
Practice](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/l8.htm){.govuk-link} and
[HSG 274](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg274.htm){.govuk-link}.

Regularly check hot water generation for functionality and if required,
temperature recording.

If the hot water system has been left operational the hot water should
be circulating as normal and regular checks, in line with guidance,
should be carried out.

Gas safety
----------

Do not isolate gas supplies to boilers and hot water generation.

To avoid the risk of leaks and dangerous build-up of gases, isolate gas
supplies where not in use, for example, in science labs and prep rooms,
design and food technology classrooms, and school kitchens. Otherwise,
gas services should remain in normal operation.

Continue planned gas safety checks including gas detection and/or
interlocking.

Fire safety
-----------

You must review and if necessary, update your fire management plans and
ensure any changes to fire escape routes are clearly identified and
communicated.

During the reduced occupancy period you must:

-   carry out weekly checks of alarms systems, call points and emergency
    lighting
-   carry out regular hazard spotting to identify escape route
    obstructions
-   check that all fire doors are operational

Fire drills should continue to be held as normal.

Kitchen equipment
-----------------

Equipment that holds water – for example, dishwashers, combination ovens
– should be run through at least a full cleaning cycle per week. This is
to remove scale build-up and standing water build-up to prevent possible
bacteria growth.

Security
--------

All areas of the school should be kept secure.

Access to certain closed areas should only be possible by relevant staff
– for example, science laboratories, chemical stores and IT rooms. Check
that access control and lockdown systems are operational.

Further [site security
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-and-college-security/site-security-guidance){.govuk-link}
is available.

Ventilation
-----------

All systems to remain energised in normal operating mode.

Where mechanical ventilation is present, recirculatory systems should be
adjusted to full fresh air. If mechanical ventilation systems cannot be
adjusted to full fresh air these should be switched off.

Where possible, occupied room windows should be open.

Ventilation to chemical stores should remain operational.

Other points to consider
------------------------

Core building-related electrical systems should remain in use/energised
in normal operating mode, this includes:

-   internal and external lighting
-   small power
-   CCTV
-   access control and alarm systems (fire, intruder, panic and
    accessible toilets)

For drainage systems, check traps have not dried out and ensure water
seals are in place to prevent smells within the building, for example,
hygiene rooms, sports hall showers.

Update your keyholder information. Intruder alarm / lift / fire alarm
companies often have remote monitoring stations (response centres) –
follow advice from these providers.

Continue with:

-   all regular cleaning
-   enhanced disinfection appropriate for the coronavirus outbreak
-   maintenance
-   testing and statutory compliance activities

Continue carrying out thorough examinations and testing of lifting and
pressure equipment during the coronavirus outbreak following the
[updated HSE
guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/work-equipment-coronavirus.htm){.govuk-link}.

Preparing for the wider opening of schools
------------------------------------------

Staff should be familiar with guidance on [actions for education and
childcare settings to prepare for wider opening from 1 June
2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-educational-and-childcare-settings-to-prepare-for-wider-opening-from-1-june-2020){.govuk-link}.
Generally, school buildings that have been completely or partially
closed, should be recommissioned as you would normally do at the end of
the school summer holiday period.

A member of staff should be identified for managing premises, reviewing
risk assessments and implementing any measures to ensure that safety is
maintained for wider opening.

Schools should review their arrangements for all building-related
systems but in particular the following areas.

### Water systems

Schools increasing operational capacity or re-opening should follow
their usual water system building management procedures as they would at
the end of the summer holidays.

Chlorinating and flushing water systems may not be necessary if the
system has remained operational through routine flushing as advised in
the [cold water systems](#cold-water-systems){.govuk-link} and [domestic
hot water services](#domestic-hot-water-services){.govuk-link} sections.

You should contact your school’s legionella competent person who will
advise on the action required. If a full system flush is required but
not immediately available seek advice from your competent person on
alternative options.

#### Drinking water

If it has not been possible to maintain system throughput of water from
routine flushing to all outlets or a competent person has not tested the
water and provided satisfactory bacterial test results, the water may
not be safe to drink. In these circumstances, you should supply bottled
drinking water until a thorough flushing and chlorination can be
undertaken by a water treatment specialist.

#### Hot water services

Water temperatures must be kept within limits recommended for the
control of legionella bacteria in water systems.

Regularly check hot water generation for functionality and if required,
temperature recording.

If the hot water system has been left operational the hot water should
be circulating as normal and regular checks should be carried out.

### Ventilation

Good ventilation is essential at all times in classrooms and
particularly during this period. Schools should ensure all systems are
working in their normal operating mode.

Natural ventilation via windows or vents should be used as far as
possible and where available occupied room windows should be open.

Where centralised or local mechanical ventilation is present,
recirculatory systems should be adjusted to full fresh air, if this is
not possible systems should be operated as normal. Where ventilation
units have filters present ensure enhanced precautions are taken when
changing filters. See HSE guidance [HSG53: Respiratory protective
equipment at
work](https://www.hse.gov.uk/respiratory-protective-equipment/index.htm){.govuk-link}.

### Fire safety

Fire safety management plans should be reviewed and checked in line with
operational changes.

Check:

-   all fire doors are operational
-   your fire alarm system and emergency lights have been tested and are
    fully operational

Carry out emergency drills. You might also need to make adjustments to
your fire drill and practise it in the first week when more pupils
return. Refer to advice on [fire safety in new and existing school
buildings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-in-new-and-existing-school-buildings){.govuk-link}.

### Cleaning

New cleaning arrangements in line with coronavirus preparations should
also include regular systematic checks:

-   on drainage systems, check traps have not dried out and ensure water
    seals are in place to prevent smells within the building, for
    example, hygiene rooms, sports hall showers
-   where toilets are put back into use ensure the flushing of the
    toilets occur with the lids down and toilet ventilation systems are
    working

Continue with:

-   all regular cleaning
-   enhanced practices appropriate for the coronavirus outbreak
-   maintenance
-   testing and statutory compliance activities

### All other systems

Recommission all systems before re-opening, as would normally be done
after a long holiday period.

This includes:

-   gas
-   heating
-   water supply
-   mechanical and electrical systems
-   catering equipment
