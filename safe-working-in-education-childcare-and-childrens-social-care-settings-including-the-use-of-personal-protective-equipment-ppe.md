    sector information on the controls measures and included information
    on the use of personal protective equipment, including for aerosol
    generating procedures.

    Updated to include changes to the system of controls in line with
    other guidance. Some formatting changes to headings have also been
    applied.

    Updated guidance on PPE supply. Added guidance about residential

    trace process.

    social care visits, shielding, staff who have been in close contact
    with a positive case and the use of face coverings.
