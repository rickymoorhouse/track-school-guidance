This guidance applies until [Step
4](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/covid-19-coronavirus-restrictions-what-you-can-and-cannot-do){.govuk-link}
of the government’s roadmap, when the current restrictions will change.

</div>

This guidance applies to:

-   staff working in education, childcare and children’s social care
    settings in England
-   children, young people and students who attend these settings
-   their parents or carers

It explains the strategy for infection prevention and control, including
the specific circumstances in which PPE should be used, to enable safe
working during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. If something is
essential for public health reasons, as advised by Public Health England
(PHE), this guidance uses the term ‘must’. This guidance does not create
any new legal obligations.

Main changes to previous guidance
---------------------------------

On 1 March we updated this guidance to include changes to the system of
controls, in line with sector specific information in the [guidance for

Effective infection protection and control
------------------------------------------

There are important actions that children and young people, their
parents and carers, and those who work with them, must take during the
coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak to help prevent the spread of the virus.

The main way of spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) is through close
contact with an infected person. When someone with coronavirus
(COVID-19) breathes, speaks, coughs or sneezes, they release particles
(droplets and aerosols) containing the virus that causes coronavirus
(COVID-19). These particles can be breathed in by another person.
Surfaces and belongings can also be contaminated with coronavirus
(COVID-19) when people who are infected cough or sneeze near them or if
they touch them. If you have coronavirus (COVID-19), there is a risk
that you will spread the virus onto surfaces such as furniture, benches
or door handles even if you do not touch them directly. The next person
to touch that surface may then become infected.

In all education, childcare and children’s social care settings,
preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) involves preventing:

-   direct transmission, for instance, when in close contact with those
    sneezing and coughing
-   indirect transmission, for instance, touching contaminated surfaces

Public Health England (PHE) advise that the way to control the virus is
the same, even with the current new variants. A range of protective
measures must be employed to reduce the risk of transmission of the
infection. These can be seen as a system of controls that, when
implemented in line with their wider risk assessment, creates an
inherently safer system in which the risk of transmission of infection
is substantially reduced. These controls are grouped into ‘prevention’
and ‘response to any infection’ and are outlined in more detail in the
following sections. We are further strengthening the measures to provide
more reassurance and to help decrease the disruption the virus causes to
education.

Information on how to implement the system of controls in each
particular setting can be found in the [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},

Prevention
----------

### [1. ]{.number} Minimise contact with individuals who are required to self-isolate by ensuring they do not attend the setting

If you have a positive test for, or are showing symptoms of, coronavirus
(COVID-19) (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or
change in, your normal sense of taste or smell - anosmia), or have
someone in your household who is (including in your support or childcare
bubble if you have one), you must not be in an education or childcare
setting. You must stay at home, in line with the [guidance for
households with possible coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

Children in residential schools and care homes who develop symptoms
should be cared for in line with the [guidance on isolation for
residential educational
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}.

If you have symptoms, you must self-isolate immediately and arrange to
have a test to check if you have coronavirus (COVID-19).

### [2. ]{.number} Ensure face coverings are used in recommended circumstances

For guidance on where face coverings should be worn in education and
childcare settings, see the [guidance on face coverings in
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education/face-coverings-in-education){.govuk-link}.
Sector specific information is available in the [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},
[guidance for specialist
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings){.govuk-link},
[guidance for early
years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures){.govuk-link},
[guidance for further
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision/what-fe-colleges-and-providers-will-need-to-do-from-the-start-of-the-2020-autumn-term){.govuk-link}
and [guidance for higher
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses){.govuk-link}.

### [3. ]{.number} Ensure everyone is advised to clean their hands thoroughly and more often than usual

Clean your hands more often than usual, particularly:

-   after arriving at the setting
-   when returning from breaks
-   when changing rooms
-   before and after eating or handling food
-   after touching your face, blowing your nose and sneezing or coughing

To clean your hands, you must wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds
with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly, or use alcohol hand
rub/sanitiser, ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.

### [4. ]{.number} Ensure good respiratory hygiene for everyone by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach

The ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach continues to be very important.
Avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose. Cover your mouth and nose with
disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If one is not available,
sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand. Dispose of
tissues into a disposable rubbish bag and immediately clean your hands
with soap and water or use a hand sanitiser. Make sure that enough
tissues and bins are available to support children, young people and
students to follow this routine.

The [e-Bug coronavirus (COVID-19)
website](https://e-bug.eu/eng_home.aspx?cc=eng&ss=1&t=Information%20about%20the%20Coronavirus){.govuk-link}
contains free resources for schools, including materials to encourage
good hand and respiratory hygiene.

### [5. ]{.number} Maintain enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products, such as detergents {#cleaning-update}

Cleaning should be generally enhanced, including:

-   more frequent cleaning of rooms or shared areas that are used by
    different groups
-   cleaning frequently touched surfaces more often than normal, such
    as:
    -   door handles
    -   handrails
    -   table tops
    -   play equipment
    -   toys
    -   electronic devices (such as phones)
-   cleaning toilets regularly
-   encouraging children, young people and students to wash their hands
    thoroughly after using the toilet
-   if your site allows it, allocating different groups their own toilet
    blocks

When cleaning, use the usual products, like detergents and bleach,
because these are very effective at getting rid of the virus on
surfaces.

All education, childcare and children’s social care settings should
follow the [PHE guidance on cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
This contains advice on the general cleaning required in addition to the
existing advice on cleaning when there is a suspected case.

### [6. ]{.number} Consider how to minimise contact across the site and maintain social distancing wherever possible {#social-distancing-update}

You must, as much as possible, alter the environment of your setting
(such as classroom layout) and your timetables (such as staggered break
times) to minimise contacts and mixing between individuals. The
overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts
between staff, children, young people and students.

Further information on how this can be implemented in each setting is
available in the [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},
[guidance for specialist

and [guidance for higher
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses){.govuk-link}.

### [7. ]{.number} Keep occupied spaces well ventilated {#ventiliation-update}

Good ventilation reduces the concentration of the virus in the air,
which reduces the risk from airborne transmission. This happens when
people breathe in small particles (aerosols) in the air after someone
with the virus has occupied an enclosed area.

It is important to ensure that occupied spaces are well ventilated and a
comfortable environment is maintained. These can be achieved using the
following measures.

#### Mechanical ventilation systems

These should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever
possible, and checked to confirm that normal operation meets current
guidance and that only fresh outside air is circulated. If possible,
systems should be adjusted to full fresh air or, if not, then systems
should be operated as normal as long as they are within a single room
and supplemented by an outdoor air supply.

#### Natural ventilation

Open windows for natural ventilation. In cooler weather, windows should
be opened just enough to provide constant background ventilation, and
opened more fully during breaks to purge the air in the space. Opening
internal doors can also assist with creating a throughput of air.

If necessary, external opening doors may also be used (as long as they
are not fire doors and where safe to do so).

#### Balancing the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature

You may want to consider:

-   opening high level windows in colder weather in preference to low
    level to reduce draughts
-   increasing the ventilation while spaces are unoccupied (for example,
    between classes, during break and lunch, when a room is unused)
-   providing flexibility to allow additional, suitable indoor clothing
-   rearranging furniture where possible to avoid direct draughts

Heating should be used as necessary to ensure comfort levels are
maintained, particularly in occupied spaces.

Further advice on this can be found in [Health and Safety Executive
(HSE) guidance on air conditioning and ventilation during the
coronavirus
outbreak](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm){.govuk-link}
and [CIBSE coronavirus (COVID-19)
guidance](https://www.cibse.org/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus,-sars-cov-2,-covid-19-and-hvac-systems){.govuk-link}.

### [8. ]{.number} Ensure individuals wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) where necessary

Face coverings are not classified as [PPE (personal protective
equipment)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe){.govuk-link}.
PPE is used in a limited number of settings to protect wearers against
hazards and risks, such as surgical masks or respirators used in medical
and industrial settings. A face covering is a covering of any type that
covers your nose and mouth.

Most staff in education, childcare and children’s social care settings
will not require PPE beyond what they would normally need for their
work, even if they are not always able to maintain a distance of 2
metres from others.

If a child, young person, or student already has routine intimate care
needs that involve the use of PPE, the same PPE should continue to be
used.

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, additional PPE is only
required in a very limited number of scenarios:

-   if an individual child, young person or student becomes ill with
    coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms and only then if a distance of 2
    metres cannot be maintained
-   when performing [aerosol generating procedures
    (AGPs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#aerosol-generating-procedures-agps){.govuk-link}

Depending on local arrangements, education and childcare settings may be
able to access PPE for their coronavirus (COVID-19) needs via their
local authority or local resilience forum. In this context, education
and childcare settings means all registered childcare providers, schools
(including independent schools, special schools, 16 to 19 academies and
alternative provision) and FE providers.

For information on the arrangements in your local area, read [personal
protective equipment (PPE): local contacts for
providers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers){.govuk-link}.

Where these local arrangements are not in place, education and childcare
settings are responsible for sourcing their own PPE. Read the [technical
specifications for personal protective equipment
(PPE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specifications-for-personal-protective-equipment-ppe){.govuk-link}.

In addition to existing procurement routes, settings and local
authorities can source PPE and cleaning products through the [Crown
Commercial Service (CCS) safer working supplies
website](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/covid-19/covid-19-buyer-information/safer-working-supplies/){.govuk-link}.
Suppliers and products listed on this website meet standards set out by
the Department of Health and Social Care. Products purchased through
this route will not detract from supply available to medical settings.
In addition, public sector buying organisations have pre-existing
experience and relationships across the education, childcare and
children’s social care sectors. Some of these organisations have
e-catalogues offering PPE and cleaning products. They include:

-   [ESPO](https://www.espo.org/catalogue){.govuk-link}
-   [YPO](https://www.ypo.co.uk/products){.govuk-link}
-   [NEPO](https://www.nepo.org/associate-membership){.govuk-link}

Regardless of local arrangements, if any education or childcare setting
has an urgent unmet need for PPE they should contact their local
authority. For urgent unmet need, local authorities should support
settings to access PPE suppliers and locally available stock, including
through coordinating the redistribution of available supplies according
to priority needs.

If the local authority or local resilience forum is unable to respond to
an education or childcare setting’s unmet urgent need for PPE, they will
need to make their own judgement in line with their risk assessment as
to whether it is safe to continue to operate.

The PPE portal can be used by children’s homes, secure children’s homes,
and all special school settings to access coronavirus (COVID-19) PPE.
These providers will have received an email invitation to register with
the portal. Go to the [PPE portal for information about ordering
PPE](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment){.govuk-link}.

### [9. ]{.number} Promote and engage in asymptomatic testing, where available {#testing-update}

Rapid testing remains a vital part of our plan to suppress this virus.
Settings should follow the guidance set out for their particular
setting:

-   [primary schools, school-based nurseries and maintained nursery
    schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-for-staff-in-primary-schools-and-nurseries/rapid-asymptomatic-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-for-staff-in-primary-schools-school-based-nurseries-and-maintained-nursery-schools){.govuk-link}
-   [secondary schools and
    colleges](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges/coronavirus-covid-19-asymptomatic-testing-in-schools-and-colleges){.govuk-link}
-   [specialist
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-full-opening-special-schools-and-other-specialist-settings/mass-asymptomatic-testing-in-specialist-settings){.govuk-link}

Response to any infection
-------------------------

### [10. ]{.number} Promote and engage with the NHS Test and Trace process

To respond if anyone within the setting is suspected or confirmed to
have coronavirus (COVID-19), education, childcare and children’s social
care settings and providers must ensure they:

-   understand the [NHS Test and Trace
    process](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-coronavirus/){.govuk-link}
-   take swift action when they become aware that someone who has
    attended has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19)
-   report confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) through the [online
    attendance form daily
    return](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form){.govuk-link} -
    settings should also continue to inform their local authority of any
    confirmed cases

Anyone who displays symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) must self-isolate
immediately and get a test. Tests for symptomatic illness can be booked
online through the [NHS Test and
Trace](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/){.govuk-link}
website, or ordered by telephone via NHS 119. Essential workers, which
includes anyone involved in education, childcare or social work, and
their households, have [priority access to
testing](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link}.
Schools and FE providers also have access to a small number of home
testing kits for use in line with our [guidance on home testing
kits](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers){.govuk-link}.

For further advice on how to respond to a confirmed case of coronavirus
(COVID-19), contact the PHE dedicated advice by calling the DfE
coronavirus helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1 for advice
on the action to take in response to a positive case. Settings will be
put through to a team of NHS Business Services Authority advisers who
will inform them of what action is needed based on the latest public
health advice. If, following triage, further expert advice is required,
the adviser will escalate the setting’s call to the PHE local health
protection team.

Based on the advice from the PHE dedicated advice service (or PHE local
health protection team if escalated), settings must ask those people who
have been in close contact with the person who has tested positive to
self-isolate for 10 full days since they were last in close contact with
that person when they were infectious.

Following the launch of the NHS COVID-19 app in England, settings may
find it helpful to refer to the [guidance on the use of the app in
schools and further education
colleges](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges){.govuk-link}.
The app is intended for use by anyone aged 16 and over, including staff
members, if they choose to do so. You should understand how the app
relates to your setting’s process for managing a positive case or an
outbreak.

Further guidance is available on [NHS Test and
Trace](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/){.govuk-link},
and there is also further [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},
[guidance for further
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link}
and [guidance for early years
providers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures){.govuk-link}.

Working safely in specific situations, including where PPE may be required
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference to PPE in the following situations means:

-   fluid-resistant surgical face masks (also known as Type IIR)
-   disposable gloves
-   disposable plastic aprons
-   eye protection (for example, a face visor or goggles)

The PPE that should be used in the following situations when caring for
someone with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) is:

-   a face mask should be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be
    maintained
-   if contact is necessary, then gloves, an apron and a face mask
    should be worn
-   eye protection if a risk assessment determines that there is a risk
    of fluids entering the eye, for example, from coughing, spitting or
    vomiting

If a child tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and needs to remain
in a residential setting, the same type and level of PPE as above should
be used.

When PPE is used, it is essential that it is used properly. This
includes scrupulous hand hygiene and following guidance on [how to put
PPE on and take it off
safely](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures){.govuk-link}
in order to reduce self-contamination.

Face masks must:

-   cover both nose and mouth
-   not be allowed to dangle around the neck
-   not be touched once put on, except when carefully removed before
    disposal
-   be changed when they become moist or damaged
-   be worn once and then discarded - hands must be cleaned after
    disposal

Residential settings (including residential schools, residential special schools and children’s homes)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children’s homes, residential special schools and colleges, and other
mainstream boarding schools, 16 to 19 academies and residential FE
providers are usually considered as ‘households’ for the purposes of the
[household self-isolation
policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

A setting’s approach to deciding what constitutes a household and who
should self-isolate because they are part of this household will depend
on the physical layout of the residential educational setting,
considering who shares a kitchen or bathroom, dormitories, and staffing
arrangements.

Residential settings in which no one is showing symptoms should operate
like any other domestic household. However, it is important that soft
toys are not shared between residents.

During current restrictions, there are exceptions that allow for contact
between parents and residents where residents do not live in the same
household as both their parents, and for contact between siblings when
they don’t live together and one or more of them is a looked-after child
or a 16 or 17 year old care leaver.

If a child in a residential setting develops symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19):

-   a test should be booked immediately to confirm whether the resident
    has coronavirus (COVID-19)
-   the [isolation guidance for residential
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}
    should be followed, including being clear on what a ‘household’ is
    in your residential setting
-   they should self-isolate immediately, avoiding contact with other
    members of the ‘household’ as much as possible
-   all other residents living in the ‘household’ should also
    self-isolate in line with [guidance for households with possible or
    confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)
    infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection){.govuk-link}
-   staff can continue to enter and leave the home as required,
    consistent staff rotas should be used where possible and staff
    should follow good infection prevention control
-   staff should wear PPE for activities requiring close contact
-   staff should adhere to distancing guidelines as far as they are able
    to but should take account of resident’s emotional needs

If a child with symptoms gets a test and the result is positive:

-   the setting should contact their local [health protection
    team](https://www.gov.uk/health-protection-team){.govuk-link} who
    will take forward the contact tracing and support the home to manage
    through their response
-   staff should wear PPE for activities requiring close contact

If a resident who has been in close contact with someone who has tested
positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) is self-isolating within a
residential setting, no additional PPE is required to be worn by staff
caring for the resident unless the resident develops symptoms and close
contact is necessary.

Where possible, residential settings should operate a consistent staff
rota to minimise the risk of transmission. If a setting is
self-isolating, they should follow careful infection control measures
during and after visits, in the same way as any self-isolating household
would if they had unavoidable visitors.

Foster care settings
--------------------

Foster homes in which no one is showing symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19) should behave like any other domestic household.

If foster carers are caring for a child who develops symptoms of
coronavirus (COVID-19), they should self-isolate immediately in line
with [guidance for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus
(COVID-19)
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection){.govuk-link}
and notify the child’s social worker. The social worker should liaise
with the fostering service to:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure that the foster home follows the guidance to avoid the spread
    of infection
-   consult the foster carer on how best to protect themselves and the
    child
-   arrange for the child to get tested through [essential workers: get
    a test today to check if you have
    coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link},
    which gives priority access to tests for essential workers and their
    households

If foster carers develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), their
fostering service should:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure that the foster home follows the [guidance for households
    with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)
    infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
    to avoid the spread of infection
-   if additional support is needed for the carer or child, ensure that
    staff providing this care are provided with PPE prior to entering
    the home and follow the guidance below on home visiting
-   direct the foster carer to book a test through [essential workers:
    get a test today to check if you have
    coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link},
    which gives priority access to tests for essential workers

Foster carers are able to request PPE from their fostering service
provider, if needed, in line with [guidance for local authorities on
children’s social
care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-authorities-on-childrens-social-care#fostering){.govuk-link}.

Staff visiting families in their own homes
------------------------------------------

We expect social workers to make face-to-face visits wherever possible.

An initial risk assessment by telephone may be helpful.

In cases where households are being required to self-isolate due to a
case, or suspected case, of coronavirus (COVID-19), or contact with
someone who has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), social
workers, other children’s social care staff and anyone else considering
the need for a home visit should follow the [children’s social care
services
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services){.govuk-link}
and make a judgement about visiting which balances considerations of
the:

-   risks to children and young people
-   risks to families
-   risks to the workforce
-   guidance on social distancing and hygiene
-   statutory responsibilities, including safeguarding

Staff and their managers are best placed to make professional judgements
of risk in each case and decide what form of contact they need.

If households report no coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, no PPE is
required, but a distance of 2 metres should be maintained where
possible. If this is not possible, you should undertake a [risk
assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#section-7){.govuk-link}.
Good basic hygiene should be followed, such as handwashing or use of
sanitiser before and after the visit, and not touching your face during
the visit.

If households are reporting coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, PPE should
be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained. Anyone
displaying symptoms should self-isolate immediately and be encouraged to
[book a coronavirus (COVID-19)
test](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested){.govuk-link}.

If it is not possible to find out whether any member of the household is
suffering from symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) before face-to-face
contact, steps should be taken where practical to mitigate risk. These
steps include but are not restricted to:

-   knocking on the front door or ringing the doorbell and then stepping
    back to a distance of 2 metres in adherence to social distancing
    guidelines
-   taking PPE as a precautionary measure

Extra care should be taken when visiting a child or young person who is
extremely clinically vulnerable and at very high risk of severe illness
from coronavirus (COVID-19) due to an underlying health condition. For
more information, read the [guidance on shielding and protecting people
who are clinically extremely vulnerable from
COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link}.

Hospital education settings
---------------------------

Hospital infection prevention and control teams will be able to advise
headteachers of hospital schools on measures required and how to work
safely in these settings.

Children with complex medical needs, such as tracheostomies
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is vital that all children, young people and students, including
those with complex or additional health needs, are supported to continue
their education and care in their education or children’s social care
setting, where it is safe to do so.

There are some additional considerations to support children, young
people and students who require procedures that may generate aerosols.
This is because aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) can increase the
risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission in the presence of a
positive case between those giving and receiving care. We recognise that
all settings, children, young people and students will have individual
needs. This guidance should be adapted to meet these specific and local
circumstances. We know from the areas where this works well that
collaboration between education and children’s social care settings,
families and local agencies to find solutions is key.

These principles for managing AGPs in education and children’s social
care settings provide a framework for this collective approach to
support the education, care and safety needs of the child, young person
or student and of the setting.

### Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)

AGPs that are commonly performed in education and children’s social care
settings include:

-   non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
-   bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP)
-   continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP)
-   respiratory tract suctioning beyond the
    oro-pharynx^[\[footnote\ 1\]](#fn:1){.govuk-link}[\[footnote\ 2\]](#fn:2){.govuk-link}^

Procedures that are not classed AGPs include:

-   oral or nasal suction
-   the administration of nebulised saline, medication or drugs
-   chest compressions or defibrillation
-   chest physiotherapy
-   the administration of oxygen therapy
-   suctioning as part of a closed system circuit
-   nasogastric tube insertion and feeding

Education and children’s social care settings, health providers and
local teams should work together to build on existing processes in place
when implementing coronavirus (COVID-19) adjustments.

Education and children’s social care settings should lead on assessments
for their setting. The child, young person or student ‘s lead health
professional should oversee their care assessments. PHE local health
protection teams can advise on infection prevention and control concerns
about the child, young person or student, or the setting. Settings
should work with the lead health professional to coordinate any
assessments required, with input from PHE local health protection teams
as needed.

Settings should be supported by local partners to review and build on
existing risk assessments. This will allow the setting to consider any
adaptations that they may need, for example, designating a room for
undertaking AGPs, or if within a classroom, making sure that all other
staff, children, young people and students are at least 2 metres
distance away (as recommended by [infection prevention and control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link}
and the system of controls set out in [sections 1 to
8](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#soc){.govuk-link})
with a window opened for ventilation.

We expect children, young people and students with complex health needs
will be able to return to their education or social care setting without
settings needing to make significant changes to their ways of work
beyond required adherence to the system of controls (as set out in
[sections 1 to
8](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#soc){.govuk-link}).
We do not envisage that settings will generally require specialist
equipment, for example, tents or airflow systems.

### Education, health and care plans

Settings and health care professionals need to work with individual
children, young people and students and their families to identify and
manage risks to support the care of the child or young person and the
safety of the setting. Where a child, young person or student has an
existing education, health and care (EHC) plan, settings and local
agencies can work together to update it as necessary, building on
current processes in place.

For children, young people and students who do not have an EHC plan, a
health assessment should be undertaken to determine levels of potential
need and risk. If an AGP may be needed when travelling to and from the
setting, this should be included in any risk or needs assessment.

### PPE

Staff performing AGPs in education or children’s social care settings
should follow the infection prevention and control guidance on [aerosol
generating
procedures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-infection-prevention-and-control-guidance-aerosol-generating-procedures){.govuk-link}
which is based on advice from the [Health and Safety Executive
(HSE)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/ppe-face-masks/face-mask-equivalence-aprons-gowns-eye-protection.htm){.govuk-link}.
They should also wear the correct PPE, which is:

-   a FFP2/3 respirator
-   gloves
-   a long-sleeved fluid repellent gown
-   eye protection

The respirator required for AGPs must be fitted by someone trained to do
so. This is known as ‘fit testing’. Staff in education and children’s
social care settings who need support with fit testing should contact
the appropriate health lead for the child or young person. This could be
through either the designated clinical officer for special educational
needs and disabilities (SEND) for support from the local clinical
commissioning group or the lead nursing team at the health provider.

Settings must be able to access the PPE they require for this purpose.
Further information on sourcing PPE can be found in [section 6 of the
system of
controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#soc6){.govuk-link}.

Healthcare professionals and others visiting settings that provide care
should follow the [infection prevention and control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link},
including the use of PPE. This describes the types of PPE that different
groups undertaking different activities should use.

### Principles

The following principles have been developed to support education and
children’s social care settings in their planning for routine AGPs.

### Risk management

Settings should work collaboratively with their local authority, PHE
local health protection team and others to consider current local
context including current coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence.

Children, young people and students, as well as staff members and all
other visiting professionals and persons, should follow the [guidance
for households with possible coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
if they or a member of their household or bubble experience coronavirus
(COVID-19) symptoms, or if they have been notified by NHS Test and Trace
to self-isolate. They should not attend the setting if they or someone
in their household are showing symptoms or have tested positive for
coronavirus (COVID-19).

### Designating a room for AGPs

Children, young people and students should ideally be taken from the
classroom for any AGP to be carried out in a designated room.

Settings should designate a room for undertaking AGPs that is adequate
for the individual and carer where possible.

The room should be adequate in size for the individual and carer and
should have all non-essential furniture or equipment removed. For the
furniture that cannot be moved, a wipeable covering should be placed on
top. The room should have a door which can be closed, and a window
opened for ventilation.

### If a designated room for AGPs is not possible

If a designated room is not possible or available, an AGP can be
undertaken within a classroom if all other staff and pupils are at least
2 metres distance away (as recommended by [infection prevention and
control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link}
and the [systems of controls set out in sections 1 to
8](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#soc){.govuk-link})
with a window opened for ventilation.

Where possible, all other pupils and persons should leave the room prior
to undertaking an AGP. This ensures the privacy of the child, young
person or student receiving an AGP, and safety for all those within
proximity.

### If using a multi-purpose room to undertake AGPs

Dependent on local situations a room may be identified as single or
multi-use.

If using a multi-use room to undertake an AGP:

-   there should be clear signage on the timing of the last AGP
-   the room should be left for an hour for aerosol settle time post
    procedure
-   the room must be cleaned before being used by another pupil or
    accessed without PPE

### Ventilation

Ventilate the room for undertaking AGPs as much as reasonably possible.

In some cases, it might be possible to seat the child, young person or
student close to a window to improve ventilation. A sensible and
pragmatic approach is required for this, particularly when the weather
is poor.

Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP is dependent on the
ventilation and air change within the room. Where possible, allow one
hour for aerosol settle time post procedure with a window open before
accessing without PPE or using again for an AGP.

### Cleaning

Remove all non-essential items from the room and minimise clutter to
make the process of cleaning the room following AGPs as straightforward
as possible.

All surfaces where particles may have settled should be cleaned as
outlined in the [guidance on cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### Children who regularly spit or require physical contact

If non-symptomatic children present behaviours which may increase the
risk of droplet transmission (such as biting, licking, kissing or
spitting) or require care that cannot be provided without close hands-on
contact, they should continue to receive care in the same way, including
any existing routine use of PPE.

The issues will be specific to each child or young person and individual
responses will be required. Staff should review and update existing risk
assessments.

In these circumstances, to reduce the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19)
transmission, no additional PPE is necessary because these are
non-symptomatic children in a non-healthcare setting and so the risk of
viral transmission is very low. However, additional space and frequent
cleaning of surfaces, objects and toys will be required. Cleaning
arrangements should be increased in all settings, with a specific focus
on surfaces which are touched a lot.

Read guidance on [cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### Non-residential settings: what should be done if a child, young person or student becomes unwell with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) and needs to be cared for until they can return home

If a child, young person or student develops symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19) (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or
change in, your normal sense of taste or smell - anosmia), and is
awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to a room where
they can be isolated behind a closed door, with appropriate adult
supervision if required depending on the needs and age of the
individual. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is
not possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2
metres away from other people.

If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they
should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be
cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being
used by anyone else.

PPE should be worn by staff caring for the child, young person or
student while they await collection if direct personal care is needed
and a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained (such as for a very
young child or a student with complex needs). Read further information
on the circumstances in which PPE should be used in [section 6 of the
system of
controls](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#soc6){.govuk-link}.

In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their
life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a
hospital, unless advised to.

Any members of staff who have provided close contact care to someone
with symptoms, regardless of whether they are wearing PPE, and any other
members of staff, children, young people or students who have been in
close contact with them, are only required to go home to self-isolate
if:

-   they develop symptoms themselves, in which case they should
    self-isolate immediately and arrange to have a test
-   the symptomatic person subsequently tests positive
-   they are requested to do so by NHS Test and Trace or the PHE advice
    service (or PHE local health protection team if escalated)
-   they have tested positive from a lateral flow device (LFD) test as
    part of a community or worker programme

Everyone should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any
contact with someone who is unwell. The area around the person with
symptoms should also be cleaned after they have left to reduce the risk
of passing the infection on to other people.

Read [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Anyone in an education, childcare or non-residential children’s social
care setting who develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) - a high
temperature, new and persistent cough or a loss of, or change in, normal
sense of taste or smell (anosmia) - however mild, should self-isolate
immediately for the next 10 full days counting from the day after their
symptoms started. If they did not have any symptoms but have had a
positive test (whether this was an LFD or polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) test), they should self-isolate from their test date.

If anyone tests positive while not experiencing symptoms, but develops
symptoms during the isolation period, they must restart the 10-day
isolation period from the day they develop symptoms.

Anybody who is contacted by NHS Test and Trace or the local health
protection team and told to self-isolate because they have been a close
contact of a positive case has a legal obligation to do so.

Protection needed when settings organise transport for children
---------------------------------------------------------------

If the children or young people being transported do not have symptoms
of coronavirus (COVID-19) or a positive coronavirus (COVID-19) test,
there is no need for additional measures to be taken. Read [COVID-19:
safer transport guidance for
operators](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#personal-protective-equipment){.govuk-link}
for further guidance on how to provide safer services.

In non-residential settings, if a child, young person or student
displays coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, or has a positive test, while
at their school they should avoid using public transport and, wherever
possible, be collected by a member of their family or household. In
exceptional circumstances, if parents or carers cannot arrange to have
their child collected, if age-appropriate and safe to do so the child
should walk, cycle or scoot home following a positive test result.

In exceptional circumstances, if this is not possible, and the setting
needs to take responsibility for transporting them home, or if a
symptomatic child or young person needs to be transported between
residential settings, you should do one of the following:

-   use a vehicle with a bulkhead or partition that separates the driver
    and passenger
-   the driver and passenger should maintain a distance of 2 metres from
    each other
-   the driver should use PPE, and the passenger should wear a face
    covering if they are old enough and able to do so

The local authority may be able to help source a suitable vehicle which
would provide appropriate protection for the driver, who must be made
aware that the individual has tested positive or is displaying symptoms.

Early years settings
--------------------

Because it is challenging to reduce contact between young children in
early years settings, regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces,
objects and toys, as well as handwashing, are particularly important.
The use of soft toys and toys with intricate parts or that are otherwise
hard to clean should be avoided.

Read guidance on [cleaning for non-healthcare

Early years settings can operate at normal group sizes. You should still
consider how you can minimise mixing within settings, for example, using
different rooms for different age groups, keeping those groups apart as
much as possible. Minimising contact between groups can reduce the
number of children and staff required to self-isolate in the event of
children or staff testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19).

We know that travel patterns differ greatly between settings. If those
patterns allow, you should consider staggered starts or adjusting start
and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave the
setting. Staggered start and finish times should not reduce the amount
of overall time children spend in the setting. A staggered start may,
for example, include keeping the length of the day the same but starting
and finishing later to avoid busy periods.

PPE for tasks involving changing nappies or general care for babies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff should follow their normal practice when changing nappies and
caring for babies more generally, provided the child is not showing
symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). This includes continuing to use the
PPE that they would normally wear in these situations, for example,
aprons and gloves. If a child shows symptoms, they should not attend a
childcare setting. They should be at home and get tested.

PPE and first aid
-----------------

Children, young people or students who require first aid should continue
to receive care in the same way. No additional PPE is needed because of
coronavirus (COVID-19) for anyone who does not have coronavirus
(COVID-19) symptoms.

Air conditioning
----------------

You can continue using most types of air conditioning system as normal.
However, if you use a centralised ventilation system that removes and
circulates air to different rooms, it is recommended that you turn off
recirculation and use a fresh air supply. Read guidance on [air
conditioning and ventilation during the coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm){.govuk-link}.

Social distancing: young children or children with SEND
-------------------------------------------------------

Young children and children with special educational needs may not be
able to understand the need for social distancing and may also seek
close interaction with their peers or adults to provide reassurance at a
period of disruption to their routines.

It is imperative that education, childcare and children’s social care
settings conduct risk assessments around managing groups of children
within the setting.

Disposing of PPE and face coverings
-----------------------------------

Used PPE and any disposable face coverings that staff, children, young
people or students wear should be placed in a refuse bag and can be
disposed of as normal domestic waste. If the wearer has symptoms of
coronavirus (COVID-19), disposal of used PPE and face coverings should
be in line with [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings outside
the
home](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Used PPE and disposable face coverings should not be put in a recycling
bin or dropped as litter. Education, childcare and children’s social
care settings should provide extra waste bins for staff and customers to
throw away disposable face coverings and PPE and should ensure that
staff and customers do not use a recycling bin.

Settings should communicate clearly to pupils, staff and visitors a
process for when face coverings should be worn within certain settings.

The safe wearing of face coverings requires cleaning of hands before and
after touching – including to remove or put them on – and the safe
storage of reusable face coverings in individual, sealable plastic bags
between use. Where a face covering becomes damp, it should not be worn
and the face covering should be replaced carefully. Staff, pupils and
students may consider bringing a spare face covering to wear in the
event that their face covering becomes damp during the day. See further
guidance on [face coverings in education
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education/face-coverings-in-education){.govuk-link}.

To dispose of waste such as disposable cleaning cloths, face coverings,
tissues and PPE from people with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19),
including people who are self-isolating and members of their household:

-   put it in a plastic rubbish bag and tie it when full
-   place the plastic bag in a second bin bag and tie it
-   put it in a suitable and secure place marked for storage for 72
    hours

This waste should be stored safely and securely kept away from children.
You should not put your waste in communal waste areas until the waste
has been stored for at least 72 hours.

Storing for 72 hours saves unnecessary waste movements and minimises the
risk to waste operatives. This waste does not require a dedicated
clinical waste collection in the above circumstances.

Settings such as residential care homes or special schools that generate
clinical waste should continue to follow their usual waste policies.

    The available evidence relating to respiratory tract suctioning is
    associated with ventilation. In line with a precautionary approach,
    open suctioning of the respiratory tract regardless of association
    with ventilation has been incorporated into the current coronavirus
    (COVID-19) AGP list. Currently, only open suctioning beyond the
    oro-pharynx is considered an AGP - oral or pharyngeal suctioning is
    not an AGP. The evidence on respiratory tract suctioning is being
    reviewed by the AGP panel. [↩](#fnref:1){.govuk-link}
