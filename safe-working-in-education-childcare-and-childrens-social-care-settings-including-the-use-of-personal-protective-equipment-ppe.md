This guidance applies to staff working in education, childcare and
children’s social care settings in England, the children, young people
and learners who attend these settings and their parents or carers.

It explains the strategy for infection prevention and control, including
the specific circumstances PPE should be used, and thus work safely
during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

Effective infection protection and control
------------------------------------------

There are important actions that children and young people, their
guardians and those who work with them can take during the coronavirus
outbreak to help prevent the spread of the virus.

Transmission of coronavirus mainly occurs via respiratory droplets
generated during breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. These
droplets can directly infect the respiratory tracts of other people if
there is close contact. They also infect others indirectly. This happens
when the droplets get onto and contaminate surfaces which are then
touched and introduced into the mouth or eyes of an uninfected person.
Another route of transmission is via aerosols (extremely small
droplets), but this is only relevant to medical procedures for a very
small number of children in education and social care settings.

In all education, childcare and children’s social care settings,
preventing the spread of coronavirus involves preventing:

-   direct transmission, for instance, when in close contact with those
    sneezing and coughing
-   indirect transmission, for instance, touching contaminated surfaces

A range of approaches and actions should be employed. These can be seen
as a hierarchy of controls that, when implemented, creates an inherently
safer system where the risk of transmission of infection is
substantially reduced. These include:

### [1. ]{.number} Minimise contact with individuals who are unwell

If you have, or are showing symptoms of, coronavirus (a new continuous
cough, or fever, or a loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste
or smell (anosmia)), or have someone in your household who is, you
should not be in a childcare setting, school or college. You should be
at home, in line with the [guidance for households with possible
coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

When working with children in residential schools and homes, you should
follow the [guidance on isolation for residential educational
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}.

### [2. ]{.number} Clean your hands often

Clean your hands more often than usual, particularly after arriving at
your setting, touching your face, blowing your nose, sneezing or
coughing, and before eating or handling food.

To clean your hands you should wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds
with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly, or use alcohol hand
rub/sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are covered.

### [3. ]{.number} Respiratory hygiene (catch it, bin it, kill it)

Avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose. Cover your mouth and nose with
disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If one is not available,
sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand. Dispose of
tissues into a disposable rubbish bag and immediately clean your hands
with soap and water or use a hand sanitiser.

### [4. ]{.number} Clean surfaces that are touched frequently

To prevent the indirect spread of the virus from person to person,
regularly clean frequently-touched surfaces, such as:

-   door handles
-   handrails
-   table tops
-   play equipment
-   toys
-   electronic devices (such as phones)

When cleaning, use the usual products, like detergents and bleach, as
these will be very effective at getting rid of the virus on surfaces.

All education, childcare and children’s social care settings should
follow the Public Health England (PHE) [guidance on cleaning for
non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### [5. ]{.number} Minimise contact and mixing

You should, as much as possible, alter the environment of your setting
(such as classroom layout) and your timetables (such as staggered break
time) to minimise contact and mixing.

### [6. ]{.number} Personal protective equipment (PPE)

The majority of staff in education, childcare and children’s social care
settings will not require PPE beyond what they would normally need for
their work, even if they are not always able to maintain distance of 2
metres from others.

PPE is only needed in a very small number of cases:

-   children, young people and learners whose care routinely already
    involves the use of PPE due to their intimate care needs should
    continue to receive their care in the same way
-   PPE should be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained
    from any child, young person or other learner displaying coronavirus
    symptoms

Education, childcare and children’s social care settings and providers
should use their local supply chains to obtain PPE. Where this is not
possible, and there is unmet urgent need for PPE in order to operate
safely, they may approach their nearest local resilience forum.

Testing
-------

Access to [testing is already available to all essential
workers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested#essential-workers){.govuk-link}.
This includes anyone involved in education, childcare or social work -
including both public and voluntary sector workers, as well as foster
carers. Education settings, as employers, can [book tests through an
online digital
portal](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test){.govuk-link}. There
is also an option for employees to book tests directly on the portal.

By the time settings open to wider cohorts of children and young people,
all children, young people and other learners eligible to attend their
education or childcare setting, and all children in social care
settings, as well as their households, will have [access to a
test](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested){.govuk-link}
if they display symptoms of coronavirus. If they develop symptoms, they
should be tested. If they test negative, they can return to their
setting and their fellow household members can end their self-isolation.
If they test positive, education and childcare settings should follow
[guidance on implementing protective measures in education and childcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings#additional-questions){.govuk-link}.
Residential settings should follow [isolation guidance for residential
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}.

How to work safely in specific situations, including where PPE may be required
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference to PPE in the following situations means:

-   fluid-resistant surgical face masks
-   disposable gloves
-   disposable plastic aprons
-   eye protection (for example a face visor or goggles)

Where PPE is recommended, this means that:

-   a facemask should be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be
    maintained from someone with symptoms of coronavirus
-   if contact is necessary, then gloves, an apron and a facemask should
    be worn
-   if a risk assessment determines that there is a risk of fluids
    entering the eye from, for example, coughing, spitting or vomiting,
    then eye protection should also be worn

When PPE is used, it is essential that it is used properly. This
includes scrupulous hand hygiene and following guidance on [how to put
PPE on and take it off
safely](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures){.govuk-link}
in order to reduce self-contamination.

Face masks must:

-   cover both nose and mouth
-   not be allowed to dangle around the neck
-   not be touched once put on, except when carefully removed before
    disposal
-   be changed when they become moist or damaged
-   be worn once and then discarded - hands must be cleaned after
    disposal

What care should be taken in residential settings, including residential schools, residential special schools and children’s care homes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Residential settings in which no one is showing symptoms should respond
to coronavirus like any other domestic household. However, it is
important that soft toys are not shared between children.

Where a child in a residential setting develops symptoms of coronavirus:

-   staff can continue to enter and leave the home as required,
    consistent staff rotas should be used where possible and staff
    should follow good infection prevention control
-   the [isolation guidance for residential
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}
    should be followed
-   staff should wear PPE for activities requiring close contact
-   staff should adhere to social distancing guidelines as far as they
    are able to, but should take account of children’s emotional needs

What care should be taken in foster care settings?
--------------------------------------------------

Foster homes in which no one is showing symptoms of coronavirus should
respond to coronavirus like any other domestic household. This should
not prevent the delivery of care to children.

If foster carers are caring for a child who develops symptoms of
coronavirus, their fostering service should:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure the foster home follows the [guidance for
    households](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
    to avoid the spread of infection
-   consult the foster carer on how best to protect themselves and the
    child

If foster carers develop symptoms of coronavirus, their fostering
service should:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure the foster home follows the [guidance for
    households](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
    to avoid the spread of infection
-   if additional support is needed for the carer or child, ensure that
    staff providing this care are provided with PPE prior to entering
    the home and follow the guidance below on home visiting

Foster carers are able to request PPE from their fostering service
provider, if needed, in line with [guidance for local authorities on
children’s social
care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-authorities-on-childrens-social-care#fostering){.govuk-link}.

What care should staff visiting families in their own homes take?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Social workers, other children’s social care staff and anyone else
considering the need for a home visit should follow the [children’s
social care services
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services){.govuk-link}
and make a judgement about visiting which balances considerations of
the:

-   risks to children and young people
-   risks to families
-   risks to the workforce
-   national guidance on social distancing and hygiene
-   statutory responsibilities, including safeguarding

Staff and their managers are best placed to make professional judgements
of risk in each case and decide what form of contact they need.

There are many ways to keep in touch with a child, young person or
family without physical face-to-face contact. It is expected that these
will be utilised appropriately and proportionately, including in
response to any risk assessment undertaken for the child on a case by
case basis.

Prior to undertaking a visit, an attempt should be made to ascertain
whether any member of the household is suffering from symptoms of
coronavirus. An initial [risk
assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#section-7){.govuk-link},
where possible, should take place by telephone.

Where households report no coronavirus symptoms, no PPE is required, but
a distance of 2 metres should be maintained where possible. Where this
is not possible, you should undertake a [risk
assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#section-7){.govuk-link}.
Good basic hygiene should be followed, such as handwashing or use of
sanitiser before and after the visit, and not touching your face during
the visit.

Where households are reporting coronavirus symptoms, PPE should be worn
if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained.

Where it is not possible to ascertain whether any member of the
household is suffering from symptoms of coronavirus prior to face to
face contact, steps should be taken where practical, to mitigate risk.
These steps include but are not restricted to:

-   knocking on the front door or ringing the doorbell and then stepping
    back to a distance of 2 metres in adherence to social distancing
    guidelines
-   taking PPE as a precautionary measure

Should social care visits to extremely clinically vulnerable children and young people continue?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra care should be taken visiting children and young people who are
extremely clinically vulnerable and so are at very high risk of severe
illness from coronavirus because of an underlying health condition. They
should follow [shielding
guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link}
and stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact where
possible.

Coronavirus brings additional risk and complexity to social work
practice and may necessitate some different ways of working which should
always be risk-based.

Visits to provide essential support such as social care or personal care
should continue only following a robust risk assessment.

What care should be taken in hospital education settings?
---------------------------------------------------------

Hospital infection prevention and control teams will be able to advise
headteachers of hospital schools on measures required and how to work
safely in these settings.

What specific steps should be taken to care for children with complex medical needs, such as tracheostomies?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a small number of medical procedures which increase the risk
of transmission through aerosols (tiny droplets) being transferred from
the patient to the care giver. These are known as aerosol generating
procedures (AGPs). Within education and children’s social care settings
these are only undertaken for a very small number of children with
complex medical needs, such as those receiving tracheostomy care.

Staff performing AGPs in these settings should follow Public Health
England’s [personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance on aerosol
generating
procedures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#ppe-guidance-by-healthcare-context){.govuk-link},
and wear the correct PPE which is:

-   a FFP2/3 respirator
-   gloves
-   a long-sleeved fluid repellent gown
-   eye protection

The respirator required for AGPs must be fitted correctly (known as ‘fit
testing’) by an individual trained to do this. Staff in education and
children’s social care settings that need support with fit testing
should contact the appropriate health lead for the child/young person.
This could be either via the Designated Clinical Officer for SEND for
support from the local Clinical Commissioning Group, or via the lead
nursing team in the health provider.

How should I care for children who regularly spit?
--------------------------------------------------

If non-symptomatic children present behaviours which may increase the
risk of droplet transmission (such as spitting), they should continue to
receive care in the same way, including any existing routine use of PPE.

To reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, no additional PPE is
necessary, but additional space and frequent cleaning of surfaces,
objects and toys will be required. Cleaning arrangements should be
increased in all settings, with a specific focus on surfaces which are
touched a lot. Read [guidance on cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

In non-residential settings, what should be done if a child, young person or other learner becomes unwell with symptoms of coronavirus and needs to be cared for until they can return home?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If anyone in an education, childcare or non-residential children social
care setting becomes unwell with a new, continuous cough or a high
temperature, or has a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste
of smell, they must be sent home and advised to follow the [guidance for
households with possible coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

If a child is awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to
a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, with appropriate
adult supervision if required depending on the age of the child.
Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not
possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2
metres away from other people.

If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they
should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be
cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being
used by anyone else.

PPE should be worn by staff caring for the child while they await
collection if direct personal care is needed and a distance of 2 metres
cannot be maintained (such as for a very young child or a child with
complex needs).

In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their
life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a
hospital.

If a member of staff has helped someone with symptoms they do not need
to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves. They should wash
their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who
is unwell. Cleaning the affected area with normal household disinfectant
after someone with symptoms has left will reduce the risk of passing the
infection on to other people. Read [guidance about cleaning
non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

What protection is needed when transporting children?
-----------------------------------------------------

If the children or young people being transported do not have symptoms
of coronavirus, there is no need for a driver to use PPE.

In non-residential settings, any child, young person or other learner
who starts displaying coronavirus symptoms while at their setting should
wherever possible be collected by a member of their family or household.
In exceptional circumstances, where this is not possible, and the
setting needs to take responsibility for transporting them home, or
where a symptomatic child or young person needs to be transported
between residential settings, you should do one of the following:

-   use a vehicle with a bulkhead
-   the driver and passenger should maintain a distance of 2 metres from
    each other
-   the driver should use PPE, and the passenger should wear a face mask
    if they are old enough and able to do so

What care should be taken in early years settings?
--------------------------------------------------

Because it is challenging to reduce contact between young children in
early years settings, regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces,
objects and toys, as well as handwashing, are particularly important.
The use of soft toys and toys with intricate parts or that are otherwise
hard to clean should be avoided. Read [guidance on cleaning for
non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Settings should manage risks by keeping children in small groups and
trying, as far as possible, to keep the same children and staff members
together from day to day. Settings should consider staggering mealtimes
and should discourage parents and carers from gathering at setting
entrances. As far as possible, parents and carers should not enter early

Is PPE required for tasks involving changing nappies or general care for babies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff should follow their normal practice when changing nappies and
caring for babies more generally, provided the child is not showing
symptoms of coronavirus. This includes continuing to use the PPE that
they would normally wear in these situations, for example aprons and
gloves. If a child shows symptoms, they should not attend a childcare
setting and should be at home.

How should I care for young children or children with special educational needs who do not understand why they must stay apart or who ignore distancing guidelines?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Young children and children with special educational needs may not be
able to understand the need for social distancing and may also seek
close interaction with their peers or adults to provide reassurance at a
period of disruption to their routines.

It is imperative that education, childcare and children’s social care
settings conduct risk assessments around managing groups of children
within the setting. This should include limiting the number of children
in each group and reducing this to provide more space in each classroom
or learning area.

As far as possible, small groups of children should be supported by
consistent staffing, and groups should remain as consistent as possible
throughout the outbreak.

How should PPE and face coverings be disposed of?
-------------------------------------------------

Used PPE and any disposable face coverings that staff, children, young
people or other learners arrive wearing should be placed in a refuse bag
and can be disposed of as normal domestic waste unless the wearer has
symptoms of coronavirus, in line with the [guidance on cleaning for
non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Any homemade non-disposable face coverings that staff or children, young
people or other learners are wearing when they arrive at their setting
must be removed by the wearer and placed into a plastic bag that the
wearer has brought with them in order to take it home. The wearer must
then clean their hands.

To dispose of waste from people with symptoms of coronavirus, such as
disposable cleaning cloths, tissues and PPE:

-   put it in a plastic rubbish bag and tie it when full
-   place the plastic bag in a second bin bag and tie it
-   put it in a suitable and secure place marked for storage for 72
    hours

Waste should be stored safely and securely kept away from children. You
should not put your waste in communal waste areas until the waste has
been stored for at least 72 hours. Storing for 72 hours saves
unnecessary waste movements and minimises the risk to waste operatives.
This waste does not require a dedicated clinical waste collection in the
above circumstances.

Settings such as residential care homes or special schools that generate
clinical waste should continue to follow their usual waste policies.

Further information is also available in the [cleaning non-healthcare
settings
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
