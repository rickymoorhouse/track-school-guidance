This guidance applies to:

-   staff working in education, childcare and children’s social care
    settings in England
-   children, young people and students who attend these settings
-   their parents or carers

It explains the strategy for infection prevention and control, including
the specific circumstances in which PPE should be used, to enable safe
working during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. If something is
essential for public health reasons, as advised by Public Health England
(PHE), this guidance uses the term ‘must’. This guidance does not create
any new legal obligations.

Main changes to previous guidance
---------------------------------

We have:

-   updated guidance on the supply of [personal protective equipment
    (PPE)](#soc6){.govuk-link}
-   added guidance for [residential settings](#residential){.govuk-link}

Effective infection protection and control
------------------------------------------

There are important actions that children and young people, their
parents and carers, and those who work with them, can take during the
coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak to help prevent the spread of the virus.

Transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) mainly occurs through respiratory
droplets generated during breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing.
These droplets can directly infect the respiratory tracts of other
people if there is close contact. They also infect others indirectly.
This happens when the droplets get onto and contaminate surfaces, which
are then touched and introduced into the mouth or eyes of an uninfected
person. Another route of transmission is through aerosols (extremely
small droplets), but this is only relevant to medical procedures for a
very small number of children in education and social care settings.

In all education, childcare and children’s social care settings,
preventing the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) involves preventing:

-   direct transmission, for instance, when in close contact with those
    sneezing and coughing
-   indirect transmission, for instance, touching contaminated surfaces

A range of protective measures must be employed to reduce the risk of
transmission of the infection. These can be seen as a system of controls
that, when implemented, creates an inherently safer system in which the
risk of transmission of infection is substantially reduced. These
controls are as follows.

### [1. ]{.number} Minimise contact with individuals who are unwell {#soc}

If you have, or are showing symptoms of, coronavirus (COVID-19) (a new
continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or change in, your
normal sense of taste or smell - anosmia), or have someone in your
household who is, you should not be in a childcare setting, school or
college. You should be at home, in line with the [guidance for
households with possible coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

Children in residential schools and care homes who develop symptoms
should be cared for in line with the [guidance on isolation for
residential educational
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}.

If you have symptoms you should arrange to have a test to check if you
have coronavirus.

### [2. ]{.number} Clean your hands thoroughly more often than usual

Clean your hands more often than usual, particularly after arriving at
your setting, when returning from breaks, when changing rooms, and
before and after eating or handling food, as well as after touching your
face, blowing your nose and sneezing or coughing.

To clean your hands, you should wash your hands thoroughly for 20
seconds with running water and soap and dry them thoroughly, or use
alcohol hand rub/sanitiser ensuring that all parts of the hands are
covered.

### [3. ]{.number} Ensure good respiratory hygiene by promoting the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach

Avoid touching your mouth, eyes and nose. Cover your mouth and nose with
disposable tissues when you cough or sneeze. If one is not available,
sneeze into the crook of your elbow, not into your hand. Dispose of
tissues into a disposable rubbish bag and immediately clean your hands
with soap and water or use a hand sanitiser.

### [4. ]{.number} Introduce enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products, such as detergents and bleach

Cleaning should be generally enhanced, including:

-   more frequent cleaning of rooms or shared areas that are used by
    different groups
-   cleaning frequently touched surfaces more often than normal, such
    as:
    -   door handles
    -   handrails
    -   table tops
    -   play equipment
    -   toys
    -   electronic devices (such as phones)

When cleaning, use the usual products, like detergents and bleach,
because these are very effective at getting rid of the virus on
surfaces.

All education, childcare and children’s social care settings should
follow the [PHE guidance on cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

### [5. ]{.number} Minimise contact between individuals and maintain distancing wherever possible

You should, as much as possible, alter the environment of your setting
(such as classroom layout) and your timetables (such as staggered break
time) to minimise contact and mixing.

### [6. ]{.number} Where necessary, wear PPE {#soc6}

Most staff in education, childcare and children’s social care settings
will not require PPE beyond what they would normally need for their
work, even if they are not always able to maintain a distance of 2
metres from others.

If a child, young person, or student already has routine intimate care
needs that involve the use of PPE, the same PPE should continue to be
used.

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, additional PPE is only
required in a very limited number of scenarios:

-   if an individual child, young person or student becomes ill with
    coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms and only then if a distance of 2
    metres cannot be maintained
-   when performing [aerosol generating procedures
    (AGPs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care/safe-working-in-education-childcare-and-childrens-social-care-settings-including-the-use-of-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#aerosol-generating-procedures-agps){.govuk-link}

Depending on local arrangements, education and childcare settings may be
able to access PPE for their coronavirus (COVID-19) needs via their
local authority or local resilience forum. In this context, education
and childcare settings means all registered childcare providers, schools
(including independent schools, special schools, 16 to 19 academies and
alternative provision) and FE providers.

For information on the arrangements in your local area, read [personal
protective equipment (PPE): local contacts for
providers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-local-contacts-for-care-providers){.govuk-link}.

Where these local arrangements are not in place, education and childcare
settings are responsible for sourcing their own PPE. Read the [technical
specifications for personal protective equipment
(PPE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specifications-for-personal-protective-equipment-ppe){.govuk-link}.

In addition to existing procurement routes, settings and local
authorities can source PPE and cleaning products through the [Crown
Commercial Service (CCS) safer working supplies
website](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/covid-19/covid-19-buyer-information/safer-working-supplies/){.govuk-link}.
Suppliers and products listed on this website meet standards set out by
the Department of Health and Social Care. Products purchased through
this route will not detract from supply available to medical settings.
In addition, public sector buying organisations have pre-existing
experience and relationships across the education, childcare and
children’s social care sectors. Some of these organisations have
e-catalogues offering PPE and cleaning products. They include:

-   [ESPO](https://www.espo.org/catalogue){.govuk-link}
-   [YPO](https://www.ypo.co.uk/products){.govuk-link}
-   [NEPO](https://www.nepo.org/associate-membership){.govuk-link}

Regardless of local arrangements, if any education or childcare setting
has an urgent unmet need for PPE they should contact their local
authority. For urgent unmet need, local authorities should support
settings to access PPE suppliers and locally available stock, including
through coordinating the redistribution of available supplies according
to priority needs.

If the local authority or local resilience forum is unable to respond to
an education or childcare setting’s unmet urgent need for PPE, they will
need to make their own judgement in line with their risk assessment as
to whether it is safe to continue to operate.

The PPE portal can be used by children’s homes, secure children’s homes,
and residential special settings to access coronavirus (COVID-19) PPE.
These providers will receive an email invitation to register with the
portal. Go to the [PPE portal for information about ordering
PPE](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ppe-portal-how-to-order-covid-19-personal-protective-equipment){.govuk-link}.

### [7. ]{.number} Where recommended, use of face coverings

From 1 September 2020, new guidance applies to the use of face coverings
in education settings – see the [guidance on face coverings in
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education/face-coverings-in-education){.govuk-link}.
Further information is also available in the [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},
[guidance for early
years](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures){.govuk-link},
[guidance for further
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-further-education-provision/what-fe-colleges-and-providers-will-need-to-do-from-the-start-of-the-2020-autumn-term){.govuk-link}
and [guidance for higher
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses/higher-education-reopening-buildings-and-campuses){.govuk-link}.

### [8. ]{.number} Engage with the NHS test and trace process and respond rapidly to confirmed cases

Education, childcare and children’s social care settings and providers
must ensure they understand the [NHS test and trace
process](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-coronavirus/){.govuk-link}
so that they know how to respond if anyone within the setting is
suspected or confirmed to have coronavirus (COVID-19). They should also
know how to contact the dedicated advice service introduced by Public
Health England (PHE) and delivered by the NHS Business Services
Authority, for further advice on how to respond to a confirmed case of
coronavirus (COVID-19) if required.

The advice service can be reached by calling the DfE coronavirus
helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1 for advice on the
action to take in response to a positive case.

Settings will be put through to a team of advisers who will inform them
of what action is needed based on the latest public health advice. If,
following triage, further expert advice is required, the adviser will
escalate the setting’s call to the PHE local health protection team.

Settings should report confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) through
the [online attendance form daily
return](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-complete-the-educational-setting-status-form){.govuk-link}.
Settings should also continue to inform their local authority of any
confirmed cases.

Anyone who displays symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) can and should
get a test. Tests can be booked at [NHS test and
trace](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/){.govuk-link}
or ordered by telephone via NHS 119. Essential workers, which includes
anyone involved in education, childcare or social work, and their
households, have [priority access to
testing](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link}.
Schools and FE providers also have access to a small number of home
testing kits for use in line with our [guidance on home testing
kits](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers/coronavirus-covid-19-home-test-kits-for-schools-and-fe-providers){.govuk-link}.

Settings must take swift action when they become aware that someone who
has attended has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on
the advice from the PHE dedicated advice service (or PHE local health
protection team if escalated), settings must ask those people who have
been in close contact with the person who has tested positive to
self-isolate for 14 days since they were last in close contact with that
person when they were infectious.

Following the launch of the NHS COVID-19 app in England, settings may
find it helpful to refer to the [guidance on the use of the app in
schools and further education
colleges](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges/use-of-the-nhs-covid-19-app-in-schools-and-further-education-colleges){.govuk-link}.
The app is intended for use by anyone aged 16 and over, including staff
members, if they choose to do so. You should understand how the app
relates to your setting’s process for managing a positive case or an
outbreak.

Further guidance is available on [NHS test and
trace](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/){.govuk-link},
and there is also further [guidance for
schools](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link},
[guidance for further
education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/actions-for-schools-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/guidance-for-full-opening-schools){.govuk-link}
and [guidance for early years
providers](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures/coronavirus-covid-19-early-years-and-childcare-closures){.govuk-link}.

How to work safely in specific situations, including where PPE may be required
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference to PPE in the following situations means:

-   fluid-resistant surgical face masks (also known as Type IIR)
-   disposable gloves
-   disposable plastic aprons
-   eye protection (for example a face visor or goggles)

The PPE that should be used in the following situations when caring for
someone with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) is:

-   a face mask should be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be
    maintained
-   if contact is necessary, then gloves, an apron and a face mask
    should be worn
-   eye protection if a risk assessment determines that there is a risk
    of fluids entering the eye, for example, from coughing, spitting or
    vomiting

If a child tests positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) and needs to remain
in a residential setting, the same type and level of PPE as above should
be used.

When PPE is used, it is essential that it is used properly. This
includes scrupulous hand hygiene and following guidance on [how to put
PPE on and take it off
safely](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-use-for-non-aerosol-generating-procedures){.govuk-link}
in order to reduce self-contamination.

Face masks must:

-   cover both nose and mouth
-   not be allowed to dangle around the neck
-   not be touched once put on, except when carefully removed before
    disposal
-   be changed when they become moist or damaged
-   be worn once and then discarded - hands must be cleaned after
    disposal

What care should be taken in residential settings, including residential schools, residential special schools and children’s homes? {#residential}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children’s homes, residential special schools and colleges, and other
mainstream boarding schools, 16 to 19 academies and residential FE
providers are usually considered as ‘households’ for the purposes of the
[household self-isolation
policy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}.

A setting’s approach to deciding what constitutes a household and who
should self-isolate because they are part of this household will depend
on the physical layout of the residential educational setting,
considering who shares a kitchen or bathroom, dormitories, and staffing
arrangements.

Residential settings in which no one is showing symptoms should operate
like any other domestic household. However, it is important that soft
toys are not shared between residents.

The [local restriction
tiers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-restriction-tiers-what-you-need-to-know){.govuk-link}
have introduced limits on people gathering indoors or outdoors. However,
there are exceptions to enable people to meet, such as for work or the
provision of voluntary or charitable services. This means, for example,
that social workers and independent visitors under regulation 44 of the
Children’s Homes (England) Regulations 2015 can continue to visit
residents.

The exceptions also allow for contact between parents and residents
where residents do not live in the same household as both their parents,
and for contact between siblings when they don’t live together and one
or more of them is a looked-after child or a 16 or 17 year old care
leaver.

If a resident in a residential setting develops symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19):

-   a test should be booked immediately to confirm whether the resident
    has coronavirus (COVID-19)
-   the [isolation guidance for residential
    settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-isolation-for-residential-educational-settings){.govuk-link}
    should be followed, including being clear on what a ‘household’ is
    in your residential setting
-   they should self-isolate, avoiding contact with other members of the
    ‘household’ as much as possible
-   all other residents living in the ‘household’ should also
    self-isolate in line with [guidance for households with possible or
    confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)
    infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection){.govuk-link}
-   staff can continue to enter and leave the home as required,
    consistent staff rotas should be used where possible and staff
    should follow good infection prevention control
-   staff should wear PPE for activities requiring close contact
-   staff should adhere to distancing guidelines as far as they are able
    to but should take account of resident’s emotional needs

If a resident with symptoms get a test and the result is positive:

-   the setting should contact the PHE dedicated advice service
    immediately and follow their advice – this can be reached via the
    DfE coronavirus helpline on 0800 046 8687 and selecting option 1
-   staff should wear PPE for activities requiring close contact

If a resident who has been in close contact with someone who has tested
positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) is self-isolating within a
residential setting, no additional PPE is required to be worn by staff
caring for the resident unless the resident develops symptoms and close
contact is necessary.

Where possible, residential settings should operate a consistent staff
rota to minimise the risk of transmission. If a setting is
self-isolating, they should follow careful infection control measures
during and after visits, in the same way as any self-isolating household
would if they had unavoidable visitors.

What care should be taken in foster care settings?
--------------------------------------------------

Foster homes in which no one is showing symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19) should behave like any other domestic household.

If foster carers are caring for a child who develops symptoms of
coronavirus (COVID-19), they should self-isolate in line with [guidance
for households with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/stay-at-home-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-covid-19-infection){.govuk-link}
and notify the child’s social worker. The social worker should liaise
with the fostering service to:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure that the foster home follows the guidance to avoid the spread
    of infection
-   consult the foster carer on how best to protect themselves and the
    child
-   arrange for the child to get tested through [essential workers: get
    a test today to check if you have
    coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link},
    which gives priority access to tests for essential workers and their
    households

If foster carers develop symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), their
fostering service should:

-   assess the ability of the carer to continue to deliver care to the
    child
-   ensure that the foster home follows the [guidance for households
    with possible or confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19)
    infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
    to avoid the spread of infection
-   if additional support is needed for the carer or child, ensure that
    staff providing this care are provided with PPE prior to entering
    the home and follow the guidance below on home visiting
-   direct the foster carer to book a test through [essential workers:
    get a test today to check if you have
    coronavirus](https://www.gov.uk/apply-coronavirus-test-essential-workers){.govuk-link},
    which gives priority access to tests for essential workers

Foster carers are able to request PPE from their fostering service
provider, if needed, in line with [guidance for local authorities on
children’s social
care](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-local-authorities-on-childrens-social-care#fostering){.govuk-link}.

What care should staff visiting families in their own homes take?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We expect social workers to make face-to-face visits wherever possible.

An initial risk assessment by telephone may be helpful.

In cases where households are being required to self-isolate due to a
case, or suspected case, of coronavirus (COVID-19), or contact with
someone who has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), social
workers, other children’s social care staff and anyone else considering
the need for a home visit should follow the [children’s social care
services
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-childrens-social-care-services){.govuk-link}
and make a judgement about visiting which balances considerations of
the:

-   risks to children and young people
-   risks to families
-   risks to the workforce
-   guidance on social distancing and hygiene
-   statutory responsibilities, including safeguarding

Staff and their managers are best placed to make professional judgements
of risk in each case and decide what form of contact they need.

If households report no coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, no PPE is
required, but a distance of 2 metres should be maintained where
possible. If this is not possible, you should undertake a [risk
assessment](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe#section-7){.govuk-link}.
Good basic hygiene should be followed, such as handwashing or use of
sanitiser before and after the visit, and not touching your face during
the visit.

If households are reporting coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms, PPE should
be worn if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained. Anyone
displaying symptoms should be encouraged to [book a coronavirus
(COVID-19)
test](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested){.govuk-link}.

If it is not possible to find out whether any member of the household is
suffering from symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) before face to face
contact, steps should be taken where practical to mitigate risk. These
steps include but are not restricted to:

-   knocking on the front door or ringing the doorbell and then stepping
    back to a distance of 2 metres in adherence to social distancing
    guidelines
-   taking PPE as a precautionary measure

Extra care should be taken when visiting a child or young person who is
extremely clinically vulnerable and at very high risk of severe illness
from coronavirus (COVID-19) due to an underlying health condition. For
more information, read the [guidance on shielding and protecting people
who are clinically extremely vulnerable from
COVID-19](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19){.govuk-link}.

What care should be taken in hospital education settings?
---------------------------------------------------------

Hospital infection prevention and control teams will be able to advise
headteachers of hospital schools on measures required and how to work
safely in these settings.

What specific steps should be taken to care for children with complex medical needs, such as tracheostomies?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is vital that all children, young people and student, including those
with complex or additional health needs, are supported to continue their
education and care in their education or children’s social care setting,
where it is safe to do so.

There are some additional considerations to support children, young
people and students who require procedures that may generate aerosols.
This is because aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) can increase the
risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission in the presence of a
positive case between those giving and receiving care. We recognise that
all settings, children, young people and student will have individual
needs. This guidance should be adapted to meet these specific and local
circumstances. We know from the areas where this works well that
collaboration between education and children’s social care settings,
families and local agencies to find solutions is key.

These principles for managing AGPs in education and children’s social
care settings provide a framework for this collective approach to
support the education, care and safety needs of the child, young person
or student and of the setting.

### Aerosol generating procedures (AGPs)

AGPs that are commonly performed in education and children’s social care
settings include:

-   non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
-   bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP)
-   continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP)
-   respiratory tract suctioning beyond the oro-pharynx
    ^[\[footnote\ 1\]](#fn:1){.govuk-link}^
    ^[\[footnote\ 2\]](#fn:2){.govuk-link}^

Procedures that are not classed AGPs include:

-   oral or nasal suction
-   the administration of nebulised saline, medication or drugs
-   chest compressions or defibrillation
-   chest physiotherapy
-   the administration of oxygen therapy
-   suctioning as part of a closed system circuit
-   nasogastric tube insertion and feeding

Education and children’s social care settings, health providers and
local teams should work together to build on existing processes in place
when implementing coronavirus (COVID-19) adjustments.

Education and children’s social care settings should lead on assessments
for their setting. The child, young person or student ’s lead health
professional should oversee their care assessments. PHE local health
protection teams can advise on infection prevention and control concerns
about the child, young person or student, or the setting. Settings
should work with the lead health professional to coordinate any
assessments required, with input from PHE local health protection teams
as needed.

Settings should be supported by local partners to review and build on
existing risk assessments. This will allow the setting to consider any
adaptations that they may need, for example, designating a room for
undertaking AGPs, or if within a classroom, making sure that all other
staff, children, young people and students are at least 2 metres
distance away (as recommended by [infection prevention and control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link}
and the system of controls set out in [sections 1 to
8](#soc){.govuk-link}) with a window opened for ventilation.

We expect children, young people and students with complex health needs
will be able to return to their education or social care setting without
settings needing to make significant changes to their ways of work
beyond required adherence to the system of controls (as set out in
[sections 1 to 8](#soc){.govuk-link}). We do not envisage that settings
will generally require specialist equipment, for example, tents or
airflow systems.

### Education, health and care plans

Settings and health care professionals need to work with individual
children, young people and students and their families to identify and
manage risks to support the care of the child or young person and the
safety of the setting. Where a child, young person or student has an
existing education, health and care (EHC) plan, settings and local
agencies can work together to update it as necessary, building on
current processes in place.

For children, young people and students who do not have an EHC plan, a
health assessment should be undertaken to determine levels of potential
need and risk. If an AGP may be needed when travelling to and from the
setting, this should be included in any risk or needs assessment.

### PPE

Staff performing AGPs in education or children’s social care settings
should follow the infection prevention and control guidance on [aerosol
generating
procedures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-infection-prevention-and-control-guidance-aerosol-generating-procedures){.govuk-link}
which is based on advice from the [Health and Safety Executive
(HSE)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/ppe-face-masks/face-mask-equivalence-aprons-gowns-eye-protection.htm){.govuk-link}.
They should also wear the correct PPE, which is:

-   a FFP2/3 respirator
-   gloves
-   a long-sleeved fluid repellent gown
-   eye protection

The respirator required for AGPs must be fitted by someone trained to do
so. This is known as ‘fit testing’. Staff in education and children’s
social care settings who need support with fit testing should contact
the appropriate health lead for the child or young person. This could be
through either the designated clinical officer for special educational
needs and disabilities (SEND) for support from the local clinical
commissioning group or the lead nursing team at the health provider.

Settings must be able to access the PPE they require for this purpose.
Further information on sourcing PPE can be found in [section 6 of the
system of controls](#soc6){.govuk-link}.

Healthcare professionals and others visiting settings that provide care
should follow the [infection prevention and control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link},
including the use of PPE. This describes the types of PPE that different
groups undertaking different activities should use.

### Principles

The following principles have been developed to support education and
children’s social care settings in their planning for routine AGPs.

#### Risk management

Settings should work collaboratively with their local authority, PHE
local health protection team and others to consider current local
context including current coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence.

Children, young people and students, as well as staff members and all
other visiting professionals and persons, should follow the [guidance
for households with possible coronavirus
infection](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance){.govuk-link}
if they or a member of their household or bubble experience coronavirus
(COVID-19) symptoms, or if they have been notified by NHS Test and Trace
to self-isolate. They should not attend the setting if they or someone
in their household are showing symptoms or have tested positive for
coronavirus (COVID-19).

#### Designating a room for AGPs

Children, young people and students should ideally be taken from the
classroom for any AGP to be carried out in a designated room.

Settings should designate a room for undertaking AGPs that is adequate
for the individual and carer where possible.

The room should be adequate in size for the individual and carer and
should have all non-essential furniture or equipment removed. For the
furniture that cannot be moved, a wipeable covering should be placed on
top. The room should have a door which can be closed, and a window
opened for ventilation.

#### If a designated room for AGPs is not possible

If a designated room is not possible or available, an AGP can be
undertaken within a classroom if all other staff and pupils are at least
2 metres distance away (as recommended by [infection prevention and
control
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control){.govuk-link}
and the [systems of controls set out in sections 1 to
8](#soc){.govuk-link}) with a window opened for ventilation.

Where possible, all other pupils and persons should leave the room prior
to undertaking an AGP. This ensures the privacy of the child, young
person or student receiving an AGP, and safety for all those within
proximity.

#### If using a multi-purpose room to undertake AGPs

Dependent on local situations a room may be identified as single or
multi-use.

If using a multi-use room to undertake an AGP:

-   there should be clear signage on the timing of the last AGP
-   the room should be left for an hour for aerosol settle time post
    procedure
-   the room must be cleaned before being used by another pupil or
    accessed without PPE

### Ventilation

Ventilate the room for undertaking AGPs as much as reasonably possible.

In some cases, it might be possible to seat the child, young person or
student close to a window to improve ventilation. A sensible and
pragmatic approach is required for this, particularly when the weather
is poor.

Clearance of infectious particles after an AGP is dependent on the
ventilation and air change within the room. Where possible, allow one
hour for aerosol settle time post procedure with a window open before
accessing without PPE or using again for an AGP.

### Cleaning

Remove all non-essential items from the room and minimise clutter to
make the process of cleaning the room following AGPs as straightforward
as possible.

All surfaces where particles may have settled should be cleaned as
outlined in the [guidance on cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

How should I care for children who regularly spit or require physical contact?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If non-symptomatic children present behaviours which may increase the
risk of droplet transmission (such as biting, licking, kissing or
spitting) or require care that cannot be provided without close hands-on
contact, they should continue to receive care in the same way, including
any existing routine use of PPE.

The issues will be specific to each child or young person and individual
responses will be required. Staff should review and update existing risk
assessments.

In these circumstances, to reduce the risk of coronavirus (COVID-19)
transmission, no additional PPE is necessary because these are
non-symptomatic children in a non-healthcare setting and so the risk of
viral transmission is very low. However, additional space and frequent
cleaning of surfaces, objects and toys will be required. Cleaning
arrangements should be increased in all settings, with a specific focus
on surfaces which are touched a lot.

Read guidance on [cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

In non-residential settings, what should be done if a child, young person or student becomes unwell with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) and needs to be cared for until they can return home?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a child, young person or student develops symptoms of coronavirus
(COVID-19) (a new continuous cough, a high temperature, or a loss of, or
change in, your normal sense of taste or smell - anosmia), and is
awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to a room where
they can be isolated behind a closed door, with appropriate adult
supervision if required depending on the needs and age of the
individual. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is
not possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2
metres away from other people.

If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they
should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be
cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being
used by anyone else.

PPE should be worn by staff caring for the student while they await
collection if direct personal care is needed and a distance of 2 metres
cannot be maintained (such as for a very young child or a student with
complex needs). Read further information on the circumstances in which
PPE should be used in [section 6 of the system of
controls](#soc6){.govuk-link}.

In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their
life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a
hospital.

Any members of staff who have provided close contact care to someone
with symptoms, even though wearing PPE, and any other members of staff,
pupils or students who have been in close contact with them, even if
wearing a face covering, do not need to go home to self-isolate unless:

-   they develop symptoms themselves, in which case, they should also
    arrange to have a test
-   the symptomatic person subsequently tests positive
-   they are requested to do so by NHS Test and Trace or the PHE advice
    service or PHE local health protection team if escalated

Everyone should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any
contact with someone who is unwell. Cleaning the affected area with
normal household disinfectant after someone with symptoms has left will
reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.

Read [COVID-19: cleaning of non-healthcare settings
guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Anyone in an education, childcare or non-residential children’s social
care setting who develops symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19): a high
temperature, new and persistent cough or a loss of, or change in, normal
sense of taste or smell (anosmia), however mild, should self-isolate for
at least 10 days from when the symptoms started; or if they are not
experiencing symptoms but have tested positive for coronavirus
(COVID-19) they should self-isolate for at least 10 days starting from
the day the test was taken.

If they have tested positive whilst not experiencing symptoms, but
develop symptoms during the isolation period, they should restart the
10-day isolation period from the day they develop symptoms.

What protection is needed when settings organise transport for children?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the children or young people being transported do not have symptoms
of coronavirus (COVID-19), there is no need for a driver to use PPE.
Read [COVID-19: safer transport guidance for
operators](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators/coronavirus-covid-19-safer-transport-guidance-for-operators#personal-protective-equipment){.govuk-link}
for further guidance on PPE and face coverings.

In non-residential settings, any child, young person or student who
starts displaying coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms while at their setting
should, wherever possible, be collected by a member of their family or
household. In exceptional circumstances, if this is not possible, and
the setting needs to take responsibility for transporting them home, or
if a symptomatic child or young person needs to be transported between
residential settings, you should do one of the following:

-   use a vehicle with a bulkhead or partition that separates the driver
    and passenger
-   the driver and passenger should maintain a distance of 2 metres from
    each other
-   the driver should use PPE, and the passenger should wear a face mask
    if they are old enough and able to do so

What care should be taken in early years settings?
--------------------------------------------------

Because it is challenging to reduce contact between young children in
early years settings, regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces,
objects and toys, as well as handwashing, are particularly important.
The use of soft toys and toys with intricate parts or that are otherwise
hard to clean should be avoided.

Read guidance on [cleaning for non-healthcare
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Settings should manage risks by keeping children in small groups and
trying, as far as possible, to keep the same children and staff members
together from day to day. Settings should consider staggering mealtimes
and should discourage parents and carers from gathering at setting
entrances. As far as possible, parents and carers should not enter early
years premises.

Is PPE required for tasks involving changing nappies or general care for babies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff should follow their normal practice when changing nappies and
caring for babies more generally, provided the child is not showing
symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). This includes continuing to use the
PPE that they would normally wear in these situations, for example,
aprons and gloves. If a child shows symptoms, they should not attend a
childcare setting. They should be at home and get tested.

Does coronavirus (COVID-19) mean that PPE is needed for administering first aid?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children, young people or students who require first aid should continue
to receive care in the same way. No additional PPE is needed because of
coronavirus (COVID-19) for anyone who does not have coronavirus
(COVID-19) symptoms.

Does coronavirus (COVID-19) mean that air conditioning should not be used?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can continue using most types of air conditioning system as normal.
However, if you use a centralised ventilation system that removes and
circulates air to different rooms, it is recommended that you turn off
recirculation and use a fresh air supply.

Read guidance on [air conditioning and ventilation during the
coronavirus
pandemic](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/equipment-and-machinery/air-conditioning-and-ventilation.htm){.govuk-link}.

How should I care for young children or children with special educational needs who do not understand why they must stay apart or who ignore distancing guidelines?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Young children and children with special educational needs may not be
able to understand the need for social distancing and may also seek
close interaction with their peers or adults to provide reassurance at a
period of disruption to their routines.

It is imperative that education, childcare and children’s social care
settings conduct risk assessments around managing groups of children
within the setting. This should include limiting the number of children
in each group and reducing this to provide more space in each classroom
or learning area.

As far as possible, small groups of children should be supported by
consistent staffing, and groups should remain as consistent as possible
throughout the outbreak.

How should PPE and face coverings be disposed of?
-------------------------------------------------

Used PPE and any disposable face coverings that staff, children, young
people or students wear should be placed in a refuse bag and can be
disposed of as normal domestic waste unless the wearer has symptoms of
coronavirus (COVID-19), in line with [COVID-19: cleaning of
non-healthcare settings outside the
home](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.

Used PPE and disposable face coverings should not be put in a recycling
bin or dropped as litter. Education, childcare and children’s social
care settings should provide extra waste bins for staff and customers to
throw away disposable face coverings and PPE and should ensure that
staff and customers do not use a recycling bin.

Settings should communicate clearly to pupils, staff and visitors a
process for removing face coverings when those who use face coverings
arrive at their setting and when face coverings are worn within a
setting in certain circumstances.

The safe wearing of face coverings requires cleaning of hands before and
after touching – including to remove or put them on – and the safe
storage of reusable face coverings in individual, sealable plastic bags
between use. Where a face covering becomes damp, it should not be worn
and the face covering should be replaced carefully. See further guidance
on [face coverings in education
settings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-in-education/face-coverings-in-education){.govuk-link}.

To dispose of waste such as disposable cleaning cloths, face coverings,
tissues and PPE from people with symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19),
including people who are self-isolating and members of their household:

-   put it in a plastic rubbish bag and tie it when full
-   place the plastic bag in a second bin bag and tie it
-   put it in a suitable and secure place marked for storage for 72
    hours

This waste should be stored safely and securely kept away from children.
You should not put your waste in communal waste areas until the waste
has been stored for at least 72 hours.

Storing for 72 hours saves unnecessary waste movements and minimises the
risk to waste operatives. This waste does not require a dedicated
clinical waste collection in the above circumstances.

Settings such as residential care homes or special schools that generate
clinical waste should continue to follow their usual waste policies.

home](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings){.govuk-link}.
